May 20, 1884-d. December 25, 1949) was an American producer, best known for founding Leon Schlesinger Studios, which later became [[Warner Bros. Animation]].\n==Early Life & Career==\nSchlesinger was born in Philadelphia. After working at a theater as an usher, songbook agent, actor, and manager (including the Palace Theater in Buffalo, New York), he founded Pacific Title and Art in 1919, where most of his business was producing title cards for silent films. As talking pictures (\"talkies\") gained popularity in 1929 and 1930, Schlesinger looked for ways to capitalize on the new technology and stay in business. Some film historians claim that he helped finance the Warner brothers' first talkie, ''The Jazz Singer.'' He then secured a contract with the studio to produce its brand-new ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' series, and he signed animators Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising to create these cartoons with their [[Bosko]] character as the star.\n\n==Leon As Businessman==\nSchlesinger was a shrewd businessman with a keen eye for talent. When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. with Bosko in 1934, Schlesinger set up his own studio on the Warner Bros. Sunset Boulevard lot at the corner of Van Ness and Fernwood. He wooed animators away from other studios, including some of those who had departed with Harman and Ising including Bob Clampett. One of these was Friz Freleng, whom Schlesinger promoted to oversee production of Looney Tunes and to develop the sister series, Merrie Melodies. Freleng's talent quickly shone through, and Schlesinger's hiring of Frederick \"Tex\" Avery, Chuck Jones and Frank Tashlin further increased the quality of the studio's output. He later added Carl Stalling and Mel Blanc and collectively these men created such famous characters as Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and Bugs Bunny. Schlesinger largely took a \"hands off\" approach to the animation unit, allowing his directors freedom to create what they wished, provided that the resulting films do well in the theaters. Schlesinger sold Pacific Title & Art in 1935 to concentrate on his animation studio.\n\n===Business practices===\nSchlesinger's hard-nosed business practices cannot be overstated. His animators worked in a dilapidated studio (Avery's unit were briefly assigned to a bungalow they dubbed \"Termite Terrace\"), and Schlesinger briefly shut down the studio in mid-1941 when unionized employees demanded a pay raise. On another occasion, he boycotted the Academy Awards for what he claimed was preferential treatment for the Walt Disney and MGM cartoon studios. He also farmed some of the Looney Tunes out to his brother-in-law, Ray Katz, for tax breaks.\n\nSchlesinger was also known (among his animators, at least) for his lisp. One oft-repeated \"official\" story states that [[Mel Blanc]] patterned the voices of both Daffy Duck and Sylvester the cat on Schlesinger. However, in Mel's autobiography, ''That's Not All, Folks!,'' he contradicts that conventional belief, writing \"It seemed to me that such an extended mandible would hinder his speech, particularly on words containing an s sound. Thus 'despicable' became 'dethpicable.'\" Daffy's slobbery, exaggerated lisp was developed over time, being barely noticeable in the early cartoons. In Daffy Duck and Egghead, Daffy does not lisp at all, except in the separately-drawn set-piece of Daffy singing ''The Merry Go Round Broke Down,'' in which just a slight lisp can be heard.\n\nAnimators who worked with Schlesinger also found him conceited and somewhat foppish, wearing too much cologne and dressing like a dandy.\n\n==Appearances in shorts==\nLeon Schlesinger appeared as himself in Freleng's 1940 short You Ought to Be in Pictures, one that combines live action with animation. In this short, Mel Blanc voices Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and all other characters, except Schlesinger who dubbed his voice because the studio didn't have a sound camera. As with other Warner cartoon staffers, Schlesinger appeared in caricature form in such cartoons as Hollywood Steps Out, Russian Rhapsody and Nutty News.\n\n==Later life and career==\nSchlesinger remained head of the animation studio until 1944 when he sold his assets to Warner Bros. He continued to market the characters and headed Warners' Theater Services unit[3] until his death from a viral infection on Christmas Day, 1949. Schlesinger also produced a number of B-movie Westerns in the 1930s. After Warner Bros. bought Schlesinger's studio in 1944, Eddie Selzer assumed Schlesinger's position as producer. Schlesinger was an avid racehorse fan and was a director of the Western Harness Racing Association. A United Press dispatch dated January 10, 1950 reported a director had been found to fill the vacancy caused by his death. He is interred in the Beth Olam Mausoleum inside the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.\n[[Category:Producers]]\n[[Category:One-Time Characters]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes]]\n[[Category:Real People]]\n[[Category:Deceased]]",

She was a discarded name and design for [[Sophitia]]'s alternate outfit in [[Soul Edge (game)|Soul Edge]]<ref>http://www.soularchive.jp/tmr/souledge/sophitia/soph_cha.htm taken on May 12, 2011</ref> and returned as a minor playable story mode only character in [[Soulcalibur IV]].\n\n\n==Biography==\n\nNothing is known about her life before becoming a servant of the Soul Edge. When [[Ivy]] meets her in the beginning of her own journey in ''Soulcalibur IV'', she tells Azola that her soul has been infected by evil.\n\nSophitia met Azola when she traveled to [[Ostrheinsburg Castle]] in order to destroy the cursed sword. Azola appeared as if out of nowhere and her words convinced Sophitia that she needed to protect Soul Edge in order to sustain the life of her daughter, [[Pyrrha]].<ref>http://www.soularchive.jp/SCBD/blog/soulchain.pdf taken on July 23, 2011. The relationship chart says that the one who appeared out of nowhere and made Sophitia trail the path of darkness was Azola.</ref>\n\nAzola is often seen accompanying [[Sophitia]] during the events of ''Soulcalibur IV'' and fighting alongside [[Nightmare]]'s minions in the surroundings of the [[Ostrheinsburg Castle]]. However, even if fighting alongside each other due to the circumstances, Sophitia bears a grudge against her.\n\nIn Sophitia's ''Soulcalibur IV ''story, Azola makes her only playable appearance, fighting alongside Sophitia. However, after they defeat [[Hilde]] and her royal guards together in the surroundings of the [[Ostrheinsburg Castle]], in the first stage of [[Sophitia]]'s Story Mode, [[Sophitia]] kills Azola with her own two hands.\n\nIn Ivy's story, Azola and [[Johan Dürer|Dürer]] seek out Ivy, finding her in the [[Wolfkrone Monument]]. Ivy recognizes that she's controlled by Evil and fights against them, defeating both.\n\nIn Maxi's story, Azola fights alongside Sophitia, [[Voldo]] and a [[Shadow]] against Maxi to stop him from entering into the Ostrheinsburg Castle, but they all lose against him. In one of the possible stories for [[Custom Characters]], Azola fights alongside Sophitia to stop Maxi and the main character from going into the castle, but they're defeated easily enough by the party, who remains strong enough to defeat Mitsurugi right afterwards.\n\nIn [[Setsuka]]'s ''Soulcalibur IV'' story, Azola, Durer and [[Solnhofen]] attack her in the [[Ostrheinsburg Castle]]'s surroundings, after she finally managed to have her vengeance against Mitsurugi, but they're all defeated by her. In [[Mitsurugi]]'s story, the same group faces Mitsurugi himself in the [[Ostrheinsburg Castle Throne Room]], only to be defeated by him, who still had enough energy afterwards to take on Taki.\n\nIn [[Cassandra]]'s ''Soulcalibur IV'' story, after the chaos created by [[Algol]]'s awakening, Durer and Azola stand by Sophitia's side when she becomes the new host of the [[Soul Edge]], but they eventually fall before a furious Cassandra.\n\nAzola survived the events of ''Soulcalibur IV'', and appears to continue to serve under Tira.\n\n==Personality==\n\nHer few quotes show her to be a ruthless warrior. Unlike Sophitia, she shows no hesitation in fighting alongside Nightmare's troops. In fact, she seems to have a way with words, able to corrupt even a warrior chosen by the gods to make her join the Soul Edge's troops.\n\nIvy describes her as infected by evil, so it's very likely that the behavior she shows in Soul Calibur IV was influenced by Soul Edge's corruption and her true personality is unknown.\n\n==Weapons==\n* Omega Sword & Owl Shield\n* [[Fire Blade]]\n\n==Fighting Style==\n\nHer fighting style was always identical to Sophitia's, both in her original conception as an alternate costume and in her actual appearance in Soul Calibur IV.\n\n==[[Critical Finish]]==\n\nAzola announces \"Your fight ends here!\" before using it. Like all of her fighting style, her Critical Finish is identical to Sophitia's.\n\n== Quotes ==\n\n===[[Soul Calibur IV]]===\n*\"''It appears I must teach you with pain.''\"\n*\"''Who are you? What are you?!''\"\n*\"''Your fight ends here!''\"\n*\"''The time has come!''\"\n*''\"All talk, and no action!\"'' (press X+O)\n\n\n\n==Creation Formula SCIV==\n\n\n1.Gender: Female\n\n2.Fighting Style: Sophitia\n\n\n\nHead: Ashigaru Headband\n\nUndergarment: Hunter's Suit\n\nUpper Body: Dancer's Breastplate\n\nArms: Snake Armlets\n\nLower Body: Belle Skirt\n\nFeet: Scorpion Greaves\n\n\n\nPhysique: Muscle:\n\nVoice: 6 Pitch: 0\n\nHair: Long\n\nFace: 04\n\n\n\nHaircolor:\n\nEyebrows:\n\nEyes:\n\nSkin:\n\n\n\nWeapon: Fire Blade\n\n\n\nSkills\n\n1.Strong Impact (CPU Only)\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n\n\nATK:\n\nDEF:\n\nHP:\n\n== Trivia ==\n\n*The only aspect of Azola's original design which remained in Sophitia's actual 2nd outfit in Soul Edge was her darker hair.\n*She's the owner of the \"sinister voice\" that convinces Sophitia to join Nightmare's troops.\n*The design of Azola's version of the Omega Sword & Owl Shield in Soul Edge was similar to the one which would eventually be used for the [[Fire Blade]], although yellow colored.\n*Azola can be easily created in Soul Calibur IV's and Broken Destiny's [[Character Creation]] modes. However in Soul Calibur V she can be created but the Dancer's Breastplate (is now an undergarment for females only) and Hunter's Suit cannot be used together.\n*Due to her outfit, Azola is rumored to be an Amazonian warrior.\n*Azola is playable in a single battle (stage 1 of Sophitia's Soul Calibur IV story)\n*As she is described as 'having been drawn to Sophitia['s darkness]', as well as her weapon choice, some speculate that she used to be one of Hephaestus's original Holy Warriors. However, there are no canon based implications to this theory. \n\n== Costumes ==\n\nAzola was originally conceived in Soul Edge as an alternate costume for Sophitia with its own name. Her main distinct traits were the brown hair, non-symmetrical chest armor, which covered only one of her breasts and a long metallic skirt. Out of those elements, only the brown hair remained in Sophitia's actual 2nd costume, which didn't use any armored parts in its design. In Soul Calibur IV, the metallic skirt was brought back, alongside her chest armor, but her armor was symmetrical this time.\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n*Loyal to [[Soul Edge]].\n*Manipulated Sophitia to become Nightmare's servant.\n*Among Nightmare's troops in [[Soul Calibur IV]], fights primarily alongside [[Sophitia]] and [[Durer]].\n*Under [[Tira|Tira's]] command.\n\n== Series' Appearances ==\n* [[Soul Blade|Soul Edge]] (Concept design)\n* [[Soulcalibur IV]] (Story mode-only character)\n\n== Gallery ==\n===Soul Blade===\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\">\nAzola_01.jpg|Azola's original design as Sophitia's 2p costume in Soul Edge\nAzola_02.jpg|Azola's original design as Sophitia's 2P costume in Soul Edge\nAzola_03(colored).jpg|Azola's original design as Sophitia's 2P costume in Soul Edge, colored.\n</gallery>\n\n===Soulcalibur IV===\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\">\nAzola_03.jpg\nAzola_(custom)_01.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Minor characters]]\n[[Category:Soulcalibur IV characters]]\n[[Category:Soul Edge characters]]\n[[Category:Soul Blade characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Servants of Soul Edge]]\n[[Category:Malfested]]",

The [[Courier]] unintentionally brought a package to the Divide from Navarro containing a mysterious ICBM detonator, causing the nuclear warheads that were still underground in their silos since the Great War to detonate. The result of the warheads exploding, on top of Big M.T.'s man-made disasters such as the earthquakes and violent storms present there that were an experiment gone awry, soon tore apart the entire area and all those residing within. The storms in particular had a profound effect on the NCR and Legion remnants; their skins were flayed off, leaving their skeletal muscle tissue exposed. At the same time, the radiation had caused a unique \"ghoulification\" process that had kept them alive, making them suffer from their heavy wounds. In dialogue between the Courier and [[Ulysses]], it can be confirmed that such injuries and radiation would have killed ordinary ghouls. This makes the marked men unique in that it is that level of radiation that is keeping them alive.\n\nDespite belonging to completely different factions with opposing ideologies when they were humans, the pain united them both into a single group. Their hate for the NCR and the Legion was turned against the Divide and its intruders. Some former legionaries of [[Caesar's Legion]] crafted crude versions of Legate equipment closely resembling [[Lanius]]'s gear, using the metal from the Divide. Others shaped crude blades as weapons, in hopes of holding on to their identity that the Divide had snatched from them. Former NCR soldiers held on to their guns, raining fire on their victims from a distance.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Biology===\nMarked men are hardened [[ghoul]]s with a fiery red color, their skins peeled off by the violent storms of the Divide. Because of this, their skeletal muscles are exposed, giving them their red appearance. They are considered ghouls, in that the intense radiation of their surroundings is keeping them alive. To protect their new skin (or more likely, themselves), they continue to wear tattered clothing from their respective factions. They maintain their clothing from scavenged pieces of scrap, such as fallen road signs, license plates, and other bits of metal. In order to feed themselves, marked men have resorted to [[cannibalism]], evident in the hunks of human meat and flesh found nearby their encampments.\n\n===Gameplay attributes===\nMarked men level with the player, have a high amount of health for humanoid opponents, and are moderately protected by the tattered armor they wear (albeit far less than properly maintained regular versions of their armor). They are overall on par with the [[White Legs tribal]]s of [[Zion Canyon]], and the [[lobotomite]]s of the [[Big MT]], in terms of health and armor.\n\nThey carry a variety of powerful melee and ranged weapons, and at higher levels (above level 40) have the unique attribute of being the only faction that almost universally uses non-standard ammunition for their weapons (i.e. slugs and armor-piercing rounds), increasing their combat proficiency against well-protected targets. Additionally, many marked men make simultaneous use of both firearms and grenades. At times, they can be found using [[Stealth Boy (Fallout: New Vegas)|Stealth Boys]], making them harder to detect.\n\nWhen near sources of radiation, they regenerate health rapidly, even more so than ordinary ghouls. However, they tend to be few in numbers, and it is rare to find more than a dozen in any particular location.\n\n==Variants==\n===Marked men hunter===\n[[file:Marked men hunter.png|right|100px]]\nMarked men hunters appear to be former NCR troopers, equipped with powerful ranged weapons. They may carry guns like [[trail carbine]]s, [[assault carbine]]s, or [[Sniper rifle (Fallout: New Vegas)|sniper rifle]]s at lower levels (level 1 to level 30), and [[anti-materiel rifle]]s, [[brush gun]]s, or [[Marksman carbine]]s at higher levels (level 30 or above). For energy weapons, they may be seen carrying [[Arc welder (Fallout: New Vegas)|arc welder]]s or [[Tri-beam laser rifle (Fallout: New Vegas)|tri-beam laser rifle]]s.\n\nMost of them are found wearing ruined NCR trooper armor (now known as the [[marked trooper armor]]), while some of them may be wearing Legion armor (called the [[marked scout armor]]).\n\n{{Stats creature FNV|start}}\n{{Stats creature FNV|row\n|name        =Marked men hunter\n|base id     ={{DLC ID|0086ef}}\n|level       =1\n|perception  =7\n|hp          =130 &rarr; 280\n|dt          = &rarr; 11\n|dr          =0\n|aggression  =1\n|confidence  =4\n|assistance  =1\n|attack1     =Melee (2 {{icon|damage}})\n|attack2     =Ranged\n|items       =* {{icon|dead}} [[Marked trooper armor]], [[marked scout armor]], [[trooper helmet]], [[goggles helmet]], [[veteran helmet]], [[veteran decanus helmet]]\n* {{icon|dead}} [[Arc welder (Fallout: New Vegas)|Arc welder]],  [[trail carbine]], [[assault carbine]], [[Sniper rifle (Fallout: New Vegas)|sniper rifle]], [[Laser rifle (Fallout: New Vegas)|laser rifle]] (level 1)\n* {{icon|dead}} [[Anti-materiel rifle]], [[brush gun]], [[marksman carbine]], [[Tri-beam laser rifle (Fallout: New Vegas)|tri-beam laser rifle]] (level 30-40)\n}}{{Stats creature FNV|end}}\n\n===Marked men marauder===\n[[file:Marked men marauder.png|right|110px]]\nMarked men maurauders are higher-ranking marked men that specialize in heavy weapons.

Despite it is set in an alternate timeline of [[James Bond]] universe, the player takes the role of an ex-MI6 agent who is recruited by [[Auric Goldfinger]], a member of a powerful unnamed criminal organization, to assassinate his rival [[Dr. No]]. Several other characters from the Bond film series make appearances throughout the game, including [[Pussy Galore]], [[Oddjob]], and [[Xenia Onatopp]] as well as [[Francisco Scaramanga]], playing a Q type character with the voice and likeness of Christopher Lee, who played the same character in 1974's ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the start of ''Rogue Agent'', a recording by [[M]] (head of MI6) reveals that: \"Three years ago, while on assignment, the agent was severely wounded in an encounter with Dr. No, and subsequently lost the use of his right eye. Consumed with vengeance, he frequently resorts to violence and brutality, and is no longer fit for service with MI6.\" According to the account, the agent was shot in his right eye by Dr. No during a mission.\n\nThree years after the incident which claimed the agent's right eye, he is evaluated through a holographic simulation in which he is paired with 007 to stop Auric Goldfinger, a member of a criminal organization, from detonating a suitcase nuke inside Fort Knox. He fails the test, and is held directly responsible for the \"death\" of 007. Charged with \"reckless brutality\", he is dismissed from MI6. As he leaves the headquarters, he is seen reading an offer by Goldfinger to enlist in his organization.\n\nThe agent accepts Goldfinger's offer and is recruited as his enforcer, meeting with him at [[Auric Enterprises]], where Goldfinger's scientists have developed a weapon known as the <small>OMEN</small> (Organic Mass Energy Neutralizer), which releases energy capable of breaking down organic matter on a nearly atomic level, resulting in disintegration. For his job of eliminating Dr. No, a fellow official of the criminal organization who has declared war on Goldfinger's branch of the organization, he is given a gold-hued cybernetic eye created by Francisco Scaramanga, another official of Goldfinger's organization (from which he receives his codename \"GoldenEye\") Scaramanga provides upgrades for the eye, starting with MRI vision. At [[Hong Kong]], GoldenEye has to get a sniper rifle to take down Dr. No with the EM hack feature. At the Midas Casino, GoldenEye has to get to the vault (which can be found in multiplayer) to protect the <small>OMEN</small> with the magnetic polarity shield. At the Hoover Dam, GoldenEye has to destroy the dam and kill Xenia Onatopp. GoldenEye also tosses Oddjob over a rail into a pit inside the Hoover Dam after he betrays and attacks GoldenEye for unknown reasons. At The Octopus, GoldenEye has to download the navigation coordinates to [[Crab Key]] with the help of the generated force field from his golden eye Dr. No's base. He is eventually sent to Crab Key, where he confronts Dr. No. During their duel, GoldenEye uses his mechanical eye to sabotage the island's nuclear reactor, causing it to electrocute Dr. No. Upon No's death, Goldfinger contacts GoldenEye and informs him that he believes he is too dangerous to be left alive, and that he had contacted GoldenEye earlier and told him to activate a program which would shut down the Lair's defense grid. Goldfinger reveals that he is intent on taking over the Lair, and leaves GoldenEye to die in the impending nuclear meltdown. GoldenEye, however, manages to escape in Dr. No's osprey before the reactor overloads and the island is destroyed in a large explosion.\n\nGoldenEye returns to the Lair intent on confronting Goldfinger. Pussy Galore rendezvous with GoldenEye and informs him that Goldfinger has used the <small>OMEN</small> to wipe out most of the Lair's guards, and taken control of it. Scaramanga provides the mechanical eye with a computer virus which he can use to overload the <small>OMEN</small>.\n\nGoldenEye fights his way through the Lair, implanting the computer virus in the process, eventually reaching the area where Goldfinger and the <small>OMEN</small> are. Goldfinger traps GoldenEye inside a chamber which he claims will soon be devoid of oxygen. The computer virus then activates the <small>OMEN</small>  causing it to explode in a burst of energy, killing Goldfinger and his troops. GoldenEye and Galore leave the Lair aboard Galore's chopper, and Scaramanga and Number One (Ernst Stavro Blofeld) later discuss what to do with GoldenEye, and decide to simply see what he does next before proceeding.\n\n==Characters==\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" class=\"article-table\" style=\"width: 100%; \"\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Goldeneye_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[GoldenEye (character)]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Dr._No_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Dr. No]] (likeness of Joseph Wiseman, voiced by Carlos Alazraqui)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Blofeld_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] (likeness of Donald Pleasence, voiced by Gideon Emery)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Generic_Bond_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[James Bond]], (likeness of Pierce Brosnan, voiced by Jason Carter)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:M_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[M]] (likeness of and voiced by Judi Dench)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Scaramanga_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Francisco Scaramanga]] (likeness of and voiced by Christopher Lee)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Galore_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Pussy Galore]] (likeness of Honor Blackman, voiced by Jeannie Elias)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Goldfinger_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Auric Goldfinger]] (likeness of Gert Frobe, voiced by Enn Reitel)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Xenia_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Xenia Onatopp]] (likeness of Famke Janssen voiced by Jenya Lano)\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[File:Oddjob_Game.png|40px]]\n| style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\"|[[Oddjob]] (likeness of Harold Sakata)\n|}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game featured a highly customizable multiplayer component with a four-player split screen play, as well as online play on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions. On November 26, 2006, the servers for both versions were shut down due to \"inactivity\" online. Players can unlock additional customization options, skins, maps, and gametype variations by playing through Story Mode and performing well. There are some locked skins such as Oddjob, Dr. No, and Xenia Onatopp. There are also locked maps such as the Pump Room, Carver's Press, the BathHouse, the Vault Core, the Lower Turbine, Dr. No's reactor, the Fissure Platform, and GoldenEye's Retreat.\n\n==Cancelled sequel==\n\nA sequel was originally planned but scrapped due to poor sales and reviews. The game's ending heavily suggested a sequel as well. According to various sources, the sequel would have included vehicles and a longer story mode. On the EA website for ''GoldenEye: Rogue Agent'', a form with many questions about what fans wanted to see in the next game was available. ''Rogue Agent'''s engine for the DS was used as a concept for a version of ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' for Nintendo's handheld (informally called Halo DS), but didn't get past verification, despite a playable demo being made.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:GoldenEye_(Transparent).gif|right]]\nRogue Agent was largely considered to be an attempt to recreate the success of one of the best-selling video games in recent history, GoldenEye 007, which was a first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64 based on the Bond film GoldenEye. Aside from the character Xenia Onatopp, the Uplink multiplayer level, and the fact that both involve a good agent going bad (although in the case of the original, not the protagonist), GoldenEye: Rogue Agent actually has nothing to do with either the film GoldenEye or its video game adaptation, although the protagonist's scarred appearance considerably resembles Sean Bean's portrayal of rogue agent, Alec Trevelyan, in that film.\n\nRogue Agent was preceded by the critically acclaimed Bond game Everything or Nothing which featured the likeness and voice talents of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe and Judi Dench, along with other Bond actors. Rogue Agent, however, was released to mediocre reviews. Reviewers criticized its lack of innovation and personality despite its unique premise, as well as its mediocre gameplay. Several reviewers also disliked its departure from James Bond canon in its introduction and killing off of characters.\n\nThe game was however noted for showcasing certain levels and multiplayer maps based on locations from the Bond movies, such as Fort Knox from Goldfinger, the space shuttle base from Moonraker, and Scaramanga's hideout from ''The Man with the Golden Gun''.\n\n==Trailer==\n{|\n|[[File:Goldeneye_Rogue_Agent_(VG)_(2004)_-_Video_Game|300px]]\n|}\n{{VideoFooter}}\n__NOEDITSECTION__\n{{James Bond video games}}\n[[Category:James Bond video games]]",

Then we'll see how long you will live.''\"\n:—Vanidas Abyss, The Black Magic Knight\n'''Sir Vanidas Abyss''' (also known as '''The Black Magic Knight''') is the son of [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Lord_Anders <u>Lord Anders</u>] and [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Heavy_Matter <u>Heavy Matter</u>] and the sister of Proffesor Nova.

His skin is Black and Dark Red, he has dragon wings, and sharp teeth. While growing up, his parents and the Enmity agents taught him how to fight, cast black magic spells, and to harness the powers of the '''Dark Element'''. In his teen years, he was made one of their top agents. He then learned of Enmity's enemies, the Steed Knights of the Chess Table.\n\nHe would commit the most hanis crimes throughout Equestria, and as the Steed Knights come after him, he'd beaten them all one-by-one with ease. Pretty soon, he knew the great Steed Knight, Sir Noble Knight, would be on his trail. When he caught up, he and Vanidas had their first battle. But in the end, it was Noble who was beaten and mortally wounded, without leaving a scratch on Abyss.\n\nVanidas later led Enmity into conquer [http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Canterlot <u>Canterlot</u>]. With the Knights defeated and the [http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Elements_of_Harmony <u>Elements of Harmony</u>] in their possession, Canterlot was vulnerable, and Princesses [http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia <u>Celestia</u>] and [http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Luna <u>Luna</u>], and any other remaining ponies were force to flee the city, leaving Canterlot conquered by Enmity.\n\nAfter a few days, Sir Vanidas Abyss learned that Sir Noble Knight has returned, fully healed, and prepared for another battle. He, his parents, the princesses, the knights, and all their allies are planning to march into the city and take it back. Lord Anders and Vanidas allowed them to come. As the battle rages, it then came between Sir Noble Knight and Sir Vanidas Abyss once again. This time, Vanidas used his Dark Powers, and Noble used his father's [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Elements_of_Chivalry <u>Element of Might</u>]. From this, they were fighting with equal power.\n\nBut then, Noble decided to take off his father's element. So Vanidas took off his element, thinking that he'll beat him again. But Noble was fully prepared for this, and he started counteracting with Vanidas. It wasn't easy, but he did it, they all did it; Noble beat Vanidas, and the princesses took back Canterlot and retrieved the Elements of Harmony.\n\nFrom that day forward, Sir Vanidas Abyss holds a personal grudge against Sir Noble, and hopes to one day beat him for good.\n==Personality[http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Sir_Vanidas_Abyss?action=edit&section=2 <u>Edit</u>]==\n:\"''My precious''' '''child that is newly born...to you, the name Vanidas Abyss shall be given.''\"\n:—Lord Anders, naming Vanidas\nVanidas Abyss is a cruel, brutal schemer, like his parents. He was trained to be a great black magic practitioner and warrior in the art of eluding, tactics, and trickery. As such, the lives of others, including that of even his own allies, hold absolutely no value to him, and he shows zero remorse for his actions.\n\nDespite his loyalty to [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Enmity_Organization <u>Enmity</u>], he has no qualms with disregarding their orders if he feels the need arises, remarking by saying \"I'd be going against the Enmity's orders, but so what? As far as I'm concerned, my job here is done\".\n\nHe is also shown to be an uncaring, cold, and ruthless individual, having not the slightest sympathy for anyone but himself and his parents. Vanidas holds everything and everyone in contempt, and holds a great resentment against [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Noble_Knight <u>Noble Knight</u>] and the friends he has.\n\nHe also possesses a high degree of arrogance, believing his skills surpass all others. This extreme overconfidence in his abilities usually leads to his downfall as he underestimates his opponents when fighting. Vanidas is also extremely calm and collected, rarely letting anything affect him. The only time when Vanidas expresses genuine concern and fear is when he has been defeated by [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Noble_Knight <u>Noble Knight</u>].\n\nAfter overhearing the Enmity agents believing he could be stronger than the Steed Knights, he adopted the nickname '''\"The Black Magic Knight\"'''. This included wearing a full-body black suit of armor specially made for him. He is short-tempered, sometimes subtle, and does not forgive easily. He holds massive hatred over the princesses, the nine elemental ponies, and the Steed Knights, especially Sir Noble Knight.\n\nHe seeks the aid of the other agents to make his plan a success, including [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Riff_Wrath <u>Riff Wrath</u>] and his daughter, [http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Femme_Fatale <u>Femme Fatale</u>].\n\nVanidas Abyss is driven by his parent's beliefs, their love, and his thirst for power.\n==Powers and Abilities[http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Sir_Vanidas_Abyss?action=edit&section=3 <u>Edit</u>]==\nVanidas is, to say the least, a skilled and extremely aggressive opponent, showing a mastery in both dark magic and close combat. He is swift and agile, able to perform complicated and nearly impossible acrobatic feats such as jumping off of a high cliff while landing squarely on his hooves, and even riding a cloud. He can teleport behind opponents at high speeds to launch attacks while leaving after-images of himself to confuse them.\n\nHe is also able to combine physical combos with magic such as attacking from above and attack his opponents from below while bombarding them with fireballs. He can also leap into the air and fire dark lightning bolts from his horn, as well as energizing himself with darkness to make his attacks more powerful. Vanidas can also fire a large beam of dark energy from his horn.\n\nHe appears to have great endurance, surviving most of his battles while taking little to no bodily damage, able to instantly get back up as if nothing happened. Vanidas also seems to possess great strength.\n\nVanidas is also a difficult opponent to fight in close combat, as he can quickly counterattack if struck multiple times, making him very dangerous.\n==Relationships[http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Sir_Vanidas_Abyss?action=edit&section=4 <u>Edit</u>]==\n===[http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Shrove_Ash <u>Shrove Ash</u>][http://bronies.wikia.com/wiki/Sir_Vanidas_Abyss?action=edit&section=5 <u>Edit</u>]===\nVanidas soon became attracted to Noble Knight's sister, Shrove Ash.

It is the fourth entry in the Jerry series, and is the only one to focus on Jerry's son, Junior.\n\n==Plot==\nJunior opens with a flashback to the original Jerry, where we see Jerry interacting with his baby son a few times before his suicide. During this time, Junior appears to be an extremely angry young child, with no love for his father. When Jerry ultimately hangs himself, he merely burps in response.\n\nAbout five years later, we see Junior storming into his kitchen, yelling for his mom to make him a grilled cheese sandwich. There, however, he finds a note explaining that she went to Reno, abandoning him in the process. At first, Junior reacts positively, and runs around the house making as big a mess as he wants. However, when he realizes that he has nobody to clean up his messes, he decides that he needs to find somebody to take care of him.\n\nUsing the household computer, Junior finds the address of his paternal grandfather, Jason. Junior is apparently able to find the right address without trouble, and knocks on Jason's front door. When Jason answers the door, Junior bluntly says \"You're my grandpa.\" Jason laughs this off and slams the door. Junior immediately rings the bell, this time demanding a grilled cheese sandwich. Junior explains that he's going to live there from now on, but Jason protests that he hates kids and never had any, making Junior's supposed relationship impossible. Therefore, unless Junior were a seventeen year old Taiwanese prostitute, Jason would not let him in.\n\nSome time later, Junior returns with a seventeen year old Taiwanese prostitute. Jason is shocked for a moment, but lets them come in. As Jason guides the prostitute to his room, he tells Junior to sit on his couch and watch television.\n\nTwo weeks later, Jason finds Junior on his couch watching TV, apparently unaware that the room had been occupied for all this time. He's angry to find that Junior's been eating his food. When Jason says its time for Junior to go, he just repeats his demands for a grilled cheese sandwich. Junior shows Jason a photo Album he found, and points out a picture of a young Jerry. Both of them insult him. Jason then goes on a rant complaining about his descendants, girls who stole his money, and his horrible job. He complains how Junior is just another pain preventing him from finding peace. The two get into a shouting match, and Junior punches Jason in the nose.\n\nAfter a moment's pause, Jason acknowledges that Junior is not like his Dad; he would never have struck out like that due to his timid nature. When Junior explains how his Jerry killed himself, Jason laughs it off, calling Jerry a \"pansy.\" The two agree that Junior was too manly to do that sort of thing, and Jason decides to make a grilled cheese sandwich for Junior.\n\nThat night, Jason reads Junior a Stephen King novel as a bedtime story in Jerry's old room, a reference to [[Jerry and the Closet]]. Unlike in that movie, however, Junior finds it relaxing. Jason and the prostitute watch him falling asleep before they leave and turn off the lights. However, at the very last minute,Jason warns Junior to stay away from the closet. The credits then roll, although attentive viewers can find Jerry in hell for a few frames.\n \n== Presentation ==\n[[File:Junior.png|thumb|Not the best first impression.]]Junior keeps the same art style as the rest of the series. Though by no means surreal, characters have exaggerated heads and somewhat simplified features. Unlike the original movie though, Junior puts a strong emphasis on voice acting, with dialogue being a large portion of the movie.\n\n== Reception ==\nAlthough successful, Junior was not a hit of the same magnitude as Jerry. As of April 2011, it has over 290,000 views and an average review of 9.6/10. However, unlike [[Jerry]], [[Jerry and The Closet]], and [[Jerry: The End]], it was never nominated for the Tank Awards. Still, it is featured in the 2009 [[Flash Portal History]] Collection.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Chronologically, this is the last entry in the Jerry series\n*Jason's ranting makes aspects of his life sound similar to Jerry's\n*Jason, Jerry, and Junior all start with the same letter, J. Their last name is Jhonson\n*The information about Jason that Junior found suggests that the movie takes place in either 2013 or 2014.\n[[Category:Flash cartoons]]\n[[Category:Comedy Movies]]\n[[Category:Dramatic Movies]]",

A man comes in to view the hall. When Dr. Neuman reaches the part concerning Loki's imprisonment, the stranger becomes very angry and transforms, revealing himself to be Loki (Alan Cumming). The tourists panic and flee, but Dr. Neuman stays to argue with the angry god. Loki takes his mask, but realizes it is a fake. In anger he removes Dr. Neuman's still talking face from his body and puts it on the mask's stand before storming out of the museum in a whirlwind of rage.\n\nIn a town called Fridge City, Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy), an aspiring cartoonist at an animation company, is feeling reluctant to become a father. He has a beautiful wife, Tonya (Traylor Howard), and a best friend, Jorge (Kal Penn), who is very shy around women. Tim has a close relationship with his dog Otis, who finds an ancient mask in a faroff creek and brings it to his owner's house.\n\nTim puts on the mask for a Halloween party, transforming into a party animal that is similar to the mask character from the first film. At the party, Tim ogles a young woman (Victoria Thaine), eagerly confronts her, and uses his powers to have her stripped down to a skimpy costume and into Jorge's arms. When the company party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his mask powers to perform a remix of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\", therefore making the party a success, and giving Tim's boss the idea for a new cartoon. Tim returns to his house and, while still wearing the mask, has sexual intercourse with his wife, conceiving a baby. The baby, when he is born, has the same powers as Loki. Meanwhile, Loki is trying to find the child born from the mask, since if he finds the child, he will find the mask.\n\nLater, Tonya goes on a business trip, leaving Tim with the baby. Tim, who has been promoted at work, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is disrupted by baby Alvie. In order to get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvie watch television; while watching a Michigan J. Frog cartoon, baby Alvie devilishly obtains the idea to mess with his father's head by using his mask powers. Meanwhile, Otis the dog, who has been feeling neglected by Tim, dons the mask by accident and becomes a crazed animal version of himself, who wishes to get rid of the baby. Tim starts to notice his son and dog's wild cartoonish behavior, when Alvie starts harassing him, while Otis attempts to attack baby Alvie, but is humorously thwarted (not really).\n\nEventually, Loki finds the mask-born baby, and confronts Tim for the mask back. When Tim is unable to present the mask to him, Loki chases him into an alley and attempts to kill him with a giant grenade, but Alvey protects his dad from the imposing danger. Before Loki attempts to attack Tim again, Odin (Bob Hoskins) possesses Tim's body, only to find that Loki has failed to obtain the mask and takes his powers away as punishment. Being freed from danger, Tim realizes he is late for the presentation of his first cartoon. Unfortunately, Tim is unprepared when he arrives, and the company head Daniel Moss (Steven Wright) fires him as a result.\n\nLoki summons Odin, and convinces him to give him his powers back for an hour, to get his mask back. He threatens Tim into showing up with the mask or else he will never see his son again. Tonya returns, and she and Tim go to find Otis who is on date with a neighbourhood dog. Tim then apologies to Otis, and convinces him to give him back the mask to save Alvie. They then meet Loki in the alley, but Loki refuses to give the baby back (after happening to have bonded with him).\n\nIt ends in a brawl between Loki and Tim, who puts on the mask again. After a crazy fight between the god and the \"superhuman\", Loki figures they are evenly matched opponents and believes that they should let the baby decide who he wants to be with. He chooses Tim after the latter delivers a tearful apology to his son for not paying attention to him. But Loki is not prepared to give up so easily, knowing the price he will have to pay if he fails in his mission. He pulls a giant hammer out, similar to the one seen in the first film, and tries to smash Tim, his wife, and the baby. As he is about to smash all three of them, Tim suddenly protects his wife and the baby from the hammer with apparent super strength. Drills come from the hammer and proceed towards Tim. Just when Loki is about to finally crush them, his time runs out and Odin comes back, and attacks him for his failure at his mission, saying that he is \"in every sense of the word, a failure\". As he is about to banish Loki, Tim stands up to the powerful god, telling him that Loki is his son, and that the most important thing in the universe is the relationship with your family. Tim then gives the mask to Loki who presents it to his father. Loki and Odin, now reconciled, return to Asgard happily.\n\nTim then comes back to work, with a great idea for a cartoon: A baby and a dog competing for Dad's attention. At the end, Tonya reveals that she is pregnant again.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jamie Kennedy]] as [[Tim Avery|Tim Avery/The Mask]]\n*[[Alan Cumming]] as [[Loki]]\n*[[Traylor Howard]] as [[Tonya Avery]]\n*[[Liam Falconer]] and [[Ryan Falconer]] as [[Alvey Avery|Alvey]]\n**[[Joyce Kurtz]], [[Mona Marshall]], [[Mary Matilyn Mouser]], and [[Neil Ross]] as the voice of Alvey\n*[[Kal Penn]] as [[Jorge]]\n*[[Steven Wright]] as [[Daniel Moss]]\n*[[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Odin]]\n*[[Ben Stein]] as [[Arthur Neuman|Dr. Arthur Neuman]]\n*[[Richard Steven Horvitz]] and [[Bill Farmer]] as the voice of [[Otis]]\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in parts of Australia and California.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sonofthemask.com/ Official site]\n* {{imdb title|id=0362165|title=Son of the Mask}}\n* {{Amg movie|291046|Son of the Mask}}\n[[Category:The Mask|2 - Son of the Mask]]",

She arrived there the same as you, in the company of your foster father Gorion, but despite this similiarity she grew up much more carefree than you did. Indeed, her lightheaded outlook has long kept her immune to the hardships of the world, though the dark confines and horrors of your current location have definitely taken their toll.}}\n\n==Quotes==\n===Baldur's Gate===\n* \"I've done had enough of this.\"\n* \"Watcha' want?\"\n* \"I care not\"\n* \"Yep?\"\n* \"This way\"\n* \"I am gone.\"\n* \"Yer a queer fellow.\"\n* \"I know nothing more, so leave me to go.\"\n* \"Good on you if you save the day.\"\n* \"Do ya wanna tell me a story bout' trollops and plug tails?

There was no recording budget left, so her lines were scraped together from voice-over left from a scrapped demo. The original character was a guard named Pique.\n*The model for Imoen's Baldur's Gate 1 portrait was the wife of the team's lead terrain artist, Dean Andersen.\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n\n* {{FRW}}\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Companions]]\n[[Category:Candlekeep]]\n[[Category:Candlekeep Coastway]]\n[[Category:Bhaalspawn]]\n[[Category:Good characters]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Thieves]]\n[[Category:Baldur's Gate (games)]]\n[[Category:Baldur's Gate: EE]]\n[[Category:Baldur's Gate II]]\n[[Category:Baldur's Gate II: EE]]\n[[Category:Mages]]",

In the LEGO city, they build buildings, and it turns out in this universe it's illegal to build apart from the instructions.

    "title": "Pay the Rent",
    "wikiText": "[[File:Pay.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pay The Rent]]\n\n==Gameplay==\nThis game is played using six grocery items and offers a top prize of $100,000 in cash. The main prop is a \"house\" with four levels. From lowest to highest, the levels are \"The Mailbox\", \"The First Floor\" (with a \"Couch\" and \"Stove\"), \"The Second Floor\" (with a \"TV\" and a \"Tub\") and \"The Attic\" (with the \"Safe\"). The Mailbox and Attic levels each contain a position for only one product; the First and Second Floors each contain positions for two products.\n\nAfter being shown the grocery products, the contestant selects an item for the Mailbox. Then, the contestant selects two items for the First Floor and two for the Second Floor, leaving the last item for the Attic. The total of the product prices on each level must be greater than the total of the price from the previous level.\n\nThe price of the item in the Mailbox is revealed, and the contestant is automatically credited with $1,000. If the combined total of the product prices on the First Floor is greater than the price of the item in the Mailbox, the contestant's winnings increase to $5,000. The contestant's winnings increase to $10,000 if the total prices of the products on the Second Floor are higher than those on the First Floor. If the product in the Attic is priced higher than the combined prices for those on the Second Floor, the contestant wins $100,000. At each level, the contestant risks the money won. Throughout the game, the contestant may choose to stop, taking the money accumulated; an incorrect guess ends the game and the contestant loses everything.\n\nThe strategy of this game is this: you don't want to put the lowest priced item in the Mailbox; you want to put the second highest price item there with the highest cost item in the Attic. As for the First and Second Floors, it depends on the items, but most likely you want to put your fourth and fifth highest-priced items on the First floor, and your third-highest and lowest-priced items on the Second floor.\n\n==History==\nThe game premiered on September 20, 2010.\n\nOn the March 27, 2013 episode, Drew Carey said that no one had won the $100,000 in this game to that point and that only two contestants (including that day's) had all the grocery items in the correct positions, but both stopped at $10,000.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, during ''Price's'' \"Big Money Week,\" history was made when contestant Ani Khojasarian, from Glendale was the first contestant to \"Pay the Rent\" (win the $100,000). With the $100,000 win, she saved \"Big Money Week\" from being a total wipeout.\n\nPay The Rent hadn't been won after its first 30 playings of the game. It was played 12 times in Season 39, 11 times in Season 40 and 7 times in Season 41, before finally being won.\n\n==YouTube Link==\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaYJwLNNbkY IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]\n[[Category:Pricing Games]]\n[[Category:Active Games]]",

It is noted as the location of the \"Money Pit\", and has attracted treasure hunters for over 200 years.\n\n==Captain Kidd's treasure==\nAt some point in his life, [[William Kidd]], a Scottish [[Piracy|pirate]], obtained a [[Shards of Eden|Shard of Eden]] – a ring-like [[Pieces of Eden|Piece of Eden]] that served as a personal shield for the wearer – and later hid it on Oak Island to keep it safe from the [[Templars]]. He also created a map providing clues to the Shard's location, and divided it among four of his former crew members. In 1777, the [[Assassins|Assassin]] [[Ratonhnhaké:ton|Connor]] sailed to Oak Island and located the Shard with the help of the maps left by Kidd, which he had acquired through seeking out the pieces.\n\nThe main landmarks of the island's treasure location included an eagle's nest, a burnt tree, a home of wolves, and a strangely shaped rock, which when viewed from the right angles, pinpointed the hiding spot of Kidd's treasure. This manifested itself as a series of tunnels beneath a plot of hard rock on the island, that held the Shard in a cavern of limestone, with eerie green crystals featured throughout it.\n\n==Reference==\n*''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''\n{{AC3}}\n[[Category:Canada]]\n[[Category:Assassin's Creed III locations]]\n[[Category:Islands]]",

    "title": "Playthrough 2",
    "wikiText": ":''For the second playthrough of [[Borderlands 2]], see [[True Vault Hunter Mode]].''\n\n'''Playthrough 2''' is a feature in Borderlands that allows players who have completed the game's story-line to start the game over again with the same character on a more advanced mode. It is unlocked once [[The Destroyer]] is defeated on playthrough one and can be accessed immediately by loading the character's game. The character retains all items and levels gained in Playthrough 1 and will face off against similarly higher level enemies in an otherwise identical story. The enemy levels range from level 32 at the start, to level 50 by the end, [[DLC|downloadable content]] enemies will similarly undergo level increases as well. Items will be encountered in higher level versions to match the enemies and general difficulty of Playthrough 2. Mission rewards will also scale. \n\n==Playthrough 2 Structure==\nThe structure of the missions in Playthrough 2 does not change. The player is forced to buy a shield and grenades despite having them from the first Playthrough. The maximum number of Weapon Equip Slot [[SDU]]s still remains at four equip slots; the missions that featured these as rewards in the first playthrough will offer different rewards in the second. Rewards for the missions will otherwise be enhanced quite noticeably with higher level items offered and in the case of the [[Claptrap Rescue missions]] a number of [[Grenade Mod]]s appear as rewards instead of SDUs, though there is a small chance of obtaining a \"bonus\" Backpack SDU during the first five rescue missions from the original game and two of the rescue missions found in the DLC's. Ammunition pickups are similarly upgraded, yielding double the amount of ammunition per item than in Playthrough 1.\n\n==Post Playthrough 2 (Playthrough 2.5)==\nWhen [[The Vault]] is first entered in Playthrough 2, all enemies throughout Pandora will see their level increased to 48-52. Items will likewise be encountered at maximum levels, with the vast majority being level 48. This setting is frequently referred to by the player community as \"'''Playthrough 2.5'''\" or \"'''Playthrough 2+'''\". The goal of this world modification is to allow players to fight balanced enemies anywhere.\n\nPlaythrough 2.5 is unlocked as soon as the mission [[Find Steele]] completes upon entering the Vault. Killing the Destroyer, or leaving it alone, has no effect on this global difficulty change.\n\n===Missions===\nNo new missions are available at this point, but unfinished missions can still be started or completed. The quality of mission rewards are not actually increased compared to classic Playthrough 2, but the higher level enemies can lead to better mission-specific loot. It is a unique chance to encounter higher level unique enemies, or high quality chests. Some missions can be useful to retain for better loot in post Playthrough 2, such as:\n*[[King Tossing]]: For [[King Wee Wee]]'s [[Wee Wee's Super Booster]]\n*[[This Bitch is Payback]]: For [[Kyros' Power]]\n*[[This Bitch is Payback]]: For the [[Typhoon]]\n*[[Purple Juice!]]: For [[Chiquito Amigo]]\n*[[Bandit Treasure: X Marks the Spot]]: For the [[Dahl Headlands]] one-time only Red Chest reward.\n\n===Patch 1.4.0+===\nThe higher level cap provided by The Secret Armory of General Knoxx \"broke\" Playthrough 2.5 in the sense that enemy levels (48-52) were no longer matched with that of the players' (61). The planned [[Patch 1.4.1]] further increased this level cap by +8 levels. [[Patch 1.4.0]] changed Playthrough 2.5 by making all enemies ''scale'' to the character's level. For example, a level 64 character will encounter level 62-66 monsters throughout Pandora.\n\n==Enemy Names==\nFor the second Playthrough, the names of all the enemy types are changed. The new enemies are more difficult but otherwise unchanged - for example, [[Bruiser (enemy)|Bruisers]] become Brutes, but their behavior remains the same. In addition, the description \"Badass\" is replaced by \"BadMutha,\" and enemies with this description are considerably more powerful than the Badasses of Playthrough 1. Reaching the end of Playthrough 2 again changes all the names, including changing \"BadMutha\" to \"SuperBad\".\n\n===Notes===\n*Badass Skags are called AssKicking Skags in Playthrough 2.5\n*None of the DLC enemies, such as [[Zombie]]s (all variation, including species), DLC3 [[Crimson Lance]], [[Prisoner]]s and [[Loot Midget]]s receive a name change.\n\n{|class=borderlands\n|+Headstone Mine\n!Playthrough 1.\n!Playthrough 2.\n!Playthrough 2.5.\n|-\n|[[File:Badass Psycho.PNG]]\n|[[File:BadMutha Maniac2.PNG]]\n|[[File:SuperBad Lunatic2.PNG]]\n|}\n[[Category:Content]]\n[[Category:Gameplay]]\n[[Category:Borderlands]]",

And feel better about yours.|The movie's tagline}}\n\n'''''The Simpsons Movie''''' is the only feature length film adaptation of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It is produced by Gracie Films for 20th Century Fox with animation produced by Film Roman and Rough Draft Studios and was released worldwide July 27, 2007. The film has been produced by [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]], and [[Richard Sakai]] and has been written by eleven of the television series' most prolific writers: Scully, Jean, Brooks, Groening, [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Matt Selman]], [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[Jon Vitti]]. The film is directed by [[David Silverman]], a former ''Simpsons'' supervising director. The film stars the regular television cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Pamela Hayden]] and [[Tress MacNeille]] stated there might be a sequel but not while the series is still in production.\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Intro ===\nThe movie starts off with the usual  [[20th Century Fox]] intro, with a twist thanks to [[Ralph Wiggum]] (humming the tune, then echoed with instruments). Then a screen purposely smaller than the screen of the viewers appears, and an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon plays. Itchy and Scratchy land on the moon. Itchy stabs Scratchy with a flagpole and abandons Scratchy. Back on Earth, Itchy becomes a hero through lying about Scratchy's death and eventually becomes the President. In his office he sees Scratchy is still alive and holding up a sign that says \"I'm telling.\" Itchy ponders on what to do and eventually decides to commence an \"accidental\" nuclear launch, launching hundreds of nuclear missiles at the moon. Scratchy screams, allowing himself to swallow the missiles. After his stomach is full, the last missile stops at the stomach and takes a boot out of the tip and kicks Scratchy. Scratchy then explodes. The entire scene is revealed to be a movie that the Simpsons family and many residents from [[Springfield]] are watching in a theater. Homer stands up calling the movie \"boring\", and announces that \"everybody in the theater is a giant sucker because they can watch the TV show at home for free, and then points at the viewer, [[wikipedia:Breaking the Fourth Wall|breaking the fourth wall]], and yells, \"Especially '''YOU'''!\"\"\n\nThe Simpsons opening intro then commences, except that instead of just the Simpsons title floating towards the viewer through the clouds, [[Professor Frink]] flies by on a flying bike with a banner attached, with the word \"MOVIE\" inscribed on it, forming the movie title. The screen then expands after Frink says \"Movie...on the ''big screen''.\" The camera then flies through [[Springfield]], showing [[Waylon Smithers]] brushing [[Charles Montgomery Burns]]' teeth, [[Apu]] changing the expiration date on a milk carton from 2006 to 2008, Martin Prince getting flagpoled by [[Dolph]], [[Jimbo]] and [[Kearney]], Bart's chalkboard gag, \"I will not illegally download this movie\", (also breaking the fourth wall) and finally Green Day playing at the end of their 3 1/2 hour concert at [[Lake Springfield]] at night. As they finish their song (''The Simpsons Theme'' with a rock twist) they try to talk for a moment about the environment, which annoys the audience and prompts the audience to throw trash at the band. The pollution in the water (about which they were trying to talk to the audience just prior) dissolves the barge floating on the lake that Green Day is playing on. They put down their rock instruments and take out violins, as the lead singer says \"gentlemen, it's been an honor playing with you tonight\" and begin to play \"Nearer, My God to Thee\" (a reference to the Movie \"Titanic\") as the barge sinks and kills them.\n\n== Main Plot ==\nAt the church service the next day, there is a brief tribute to the passing of Green Day, the most recent band to die in Springfield. [[Mrs. Glick]] plays a funeral version of American Idiot. The Simpsons then arrive late. After the parishioners overhear Homer's rants about going to Church, Reverend [[Timothy Lovejoy]] is up to the prayers of the faithful. First Ned told the Reverend that he had to confess to an \"immodest sense of pride in our community\" (Although Homer hoped that Flanders would confess to being gay), although Lovejoy then amends his statement to exclude Flanders this time around before Flanders could mention it. [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] is suddenly possessed and begins to scream of a coming disaster foreshadowing the events on the film, involving a \"''twisted tail''\", \"''a thousand eyes''\", \"''trapped forever''\" and ''\"Eeeepa\"''. This leads Marge to believe that God is sending them a message warning them about a future catastrophe (and is ultimately correct).\n\nLater that day, Homer does some chores, including the removal of a hornets nest (which he places inside the mailbox of the Flanders) and the fixing of a sinkhole in the backyard (which he covers with a sandbox, and then using Maggie as a makeshift plug when that didn't work). After an unsuccessful attempt to fix the roof, Homer and Bart play a game of dare. Homer dares Bart to climb the TV Antenna, and although Bart succeeds rather easily, Homer shakes the antenna while declaring \"earthquake!\", causing him to nearly fall off the house, and then hang on for dear life as Homer shakes the gutters after declaring \"aftershock!\", though he has fun doing so. After Bart shoots at Homer with a BB gun while Homer carries a load of bricks, Homer dares Bart to skateboard to [[Krusty Burger]] and back naked. Bart refuses at first, but then does so after Homer threatens to call him a \"chicken\" for life.\n\n[[File:Simpsons movie trailer 3.png|thumb|left|300px|[[Rod]] and [[Todd Flanders]] say a prayer, which was accidently ruined by [[Ned]] shouting in the middle of it.]] His nudity is noticed by many people. He is chased by Chief Wiggum in a patrol car, who disables his skateboard. He leaves Bart handcuffed to a pole, as Nelson began laughing at him till sundown and his throat is hoarse. Homer then arrives, but blames everything on Bart and allows the boy to go to court after hearing that he would have to take a single 1 hour parenting course if he admitted that he dared Bart. He then gets Bart new clothes but forgets to bring pants. Walking into Krusty Burger, Ned Flanders shows fatherly compassion towards Bart by providing him pants. Before Bart could display his anger at Homer, Homer adopts [[Plopper|a pig]] as a pet when [[Krusty the Clown]] orders it to be killed shortly after taping a commercial nearby.\n\n[[File:The clogger.jpg||thumb|200px|left|The Clogger]]\n\nMeanwhile, while [[Lisa]] tries to get signatures for a petition to clean up Lake Springfield (unsuccessfully), She meets an Irish boy named [[Colin]], who is doing exactly the same thing as Lisa. Colin just moved in and his father is a musician (Lisa thought it was Bono but Colin refutes her). Lisa starts to develop a crush on Colin after finding out that he can play four different instruments.\n\n[[Marge]] obtains cell phone footage of Grampa's outburst at Church recorded by [[Comic Book Guy]] in exchange for giving Comic Book Guy her pregnancy pants. When she becomes confused about the meaning of \"Eeepa,\" Comic Book Guy responds, \"I believe that's the sound Green Lantern made, when Sinestro threw him into a vat of acid\". When Homer Simpson shows Marge his new pig, Marge remembers what Grampa Simpson said about a \"twisted tail\" and pleads for Homer to take it away. However, Homer wins her over by showing her that the pig can imitate her squeal and his belching.\n\nBart is stuck outside feeling alone, while his dad, Homer, ignores him over Spider Pig/Harry Plopper. This prompts Bart to angrily aim his slingshot at Homer, but Ned Flanders calms him down, offering to go fishing with him. Bart decides after some thought that it is probably a good idea, especially as the only time he went fishing with his dad, Homer ended up using a bug-zapper to in essence cheat in fishing, as well as being electrified as a result of trying to eat the still electrified fish. While fishing, Bart accidentally lets go of Flander's best rod. To his surprise, however, Flanders doesn't even strangle him (he instinctively starts choking himself before realizing that Flanders isn't strangling him.) and starts to develop a father and son bond with him.\n\nLisa and Colin combine their efforts to give a presentation called \"An Irritating Truth\" at Town Hall. But because the average Springfielder could care less about the environment, and namely seemed to miss the overall point anyways, such as when she accidentally focused on her crush on Colin and when her moving platform briefly malfunctioned before she could get it to the height needed to demonstrate her point, she reveals that she put the lake water in their drinking glasses, causing everyone to spit out the water they just drank. When Lisa's tactic is successful, Moe suggests to the town that they hate kids, but Mayor Quimby, gets to Lisa's point. He forbids any more dumping and declares a state of emergency, and the entire townspeople tidies [[Lake Springfield]]. Mayor Quimby proves the effectiveness of their \"idiot proof\" barrier by telling Cletus to try dumping a dead possum in the lake only to walk into the concrete barricade.[[File:Acid Shooting Ray.png|thumb|200px|right|\"I've invented an acid-firing super drill that can cut through anything! It's right over there... just outside of the dome\"]]\n\n[[File:The Simpsons Movie Movie Clip - Spider Pig|thumb|right|345 px|Spider Pig/Hairy Plopper]]Marge realizes Homer named the pig \"Spider-Pig\" and he keeps the pig's (and his own) waste in an almost overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, who tells Homer to dispose of it safely. She even encourages him to take Spider-Pig with him, but he states that he has renamed him \"Harry Plopper\" as he's now wearing glasses and has a lightning bolt scar. While waiting in a queue at the waste disposal plant, Homer is told by Lenny that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down for health violations and that they are giving away free donuts. Homer decides on a quicker means of disposal and drives to the lake, ignoring the no dumping signs (as well as running over [[Hans Moleman]] who was carrying a \"you suck\" sign) and smashing through the concrete barrier with no damage to his car whatsoever, and dumps the silo into the wonderfully clean lake, causing it to become heavily re-polluted almost instantly. Shortly a squirrel dives in while attempting to escape a raccoon that was trying to hunt it down, and is severely mutated, giving it \"a thousand eyes\", another part of Grampa Simpsons's prophetical vision. Nearby, Flanders and Bart bond during a hike and discover the mutated squirrel (Ned thinks it is part of God's design), which is then captured by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), although the representatives of the EPA also warn Bart (who was attempting to poke its eyes out) that any more eyepoking would have become a felony. [[Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, tells [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|President Schwarzenegger]] that Springfield is so polluted that the government must take drastic action. He provides Schwarzenegger with five options and he picks option 3 at random without looking, saying he was elected to \"lead, not to read\".\n\nOption 3 was to trap the entire town of Springfield under a gigantic dome. A hundred helicopters hoist the dome over the town and places it upon Springfield (flattening a man in the process), much to the horror of the Simpsons and the inhabitants of Springfield. Marge sees the words EPA on the side of the helicopter and realizes that Grampa's prophecy has come true. After several futile attempts to crack the dome by the Springfield Police Department and [[Sideshow Mel]], Russ Cargill appears on a gigantic television screen and explains to the citizens of Springfield that their lake has become extremely polluted and to prevent the pollution from spreading out of Springfield, they trapped them under the dome, removing Springfield from the state map in the process (showing a picture of a man using a sat nav telling him \"–\" is up ahead). Though Lisa states that they've cleaned up, Cargill throws back that someone did not get the message.\n\n[[Kent Brockman]] calls the incident \"[[Trappuccino]]\", and reports the shortage of supplies like gasoline, air, and Botox (to which, after making this statement, his face disfigures, and then Brockman has to pause for a moment before he attaches a chip clip onto himself to regain his stern face). The swallows being devoured by cats on their return to Springfield, and the ad for \"Dome Depot\" is now the result of their entrapment.\n\nMarge claims to see Maggie on the other side of the dome, but when she brings Homer, Maggie is inside. When they're not looking, Maggie goes into the sinkhole that Homer covered with the sandbox and ends up of the other side, and then back.\n\nThe members of the Springfield Police Department [[Clancy Wiggum]] in association with [[Eddie and Lou]] soon find the pig waste silo in the lake, with the words \"Please return to Homer Simpson, No Reward\" written on the side. Homer and Marge see a live news broadcast of the discovery, and Marge chides Homer over the fact that he did NOT listen to her after she warns him, but Homer simply says that \"nobody watches the channel anyway\". Contray to his belief, within seconds, a massive angry mob approaches the Simpson's home intending to kill Homer (formed mainly by Kent Brockman's encouragement of forming a vigilante mob in retribution as it would \"have results\").[[File:simpsons angry mob.png|thumb|left|300px|An angry mob of Springfieldians hunting for Homer Simpson.]] Homer fears that [[Angry Mob|The Mob]] will go after his family but the mob interjects that they just want him, and even Grampa is in it. Ned tells Bart and his family to crawl on a plank to his house, but Spider Pig/Harry Plopper pushes the plank off the windowsill, causing the family to fall down. Homer lands on a barbecue and, despite the situation, eats a shrimp and says his luck is beginning to turn.\n\n[[File:Homer eating shrimp2.png|right|thumb|200px|Homer eating a shrimp with his tongue]]\nThe family run to their car, but Marge runs back into the flaming house to get their Wedding Video (and wash a few dishes), and escapes to the automobile, but their escape is futile as [[Snake Jailbird]] and the others pick up their car and move it towards the backyard. The mob has prepared a noose for every member of the Simpsons family, including Maggie (Maggie's noose has a red pacifier attached) despite the fact that they said they only wanted Homer. The family manages to escape onto the treehouse by climbing on the nooses, but Homer gets stuck on one of them. [[Homer]] attempts to apologize to the crowd but is responded with a hit from the non-sharp end of a powersaw. [[Otto Mann]] chains his schoolbus to the treehouse and attempts to pull it down. The family barely escapes when Maggie shows them an escape route through the sinkhole in the sandbox. Homer due to his size gets trapped in the sinkhole, but eventually goes through, but not before getting his head clawed by the mob. Chief Wiggum, Lou and Eddie shoot at the sandbox, but in the process causing the sinkhole to grow. The townspeople flee the area as the sinkhole devours the Simpson's house, including the car, the treehouse and even Santa's Little Helper's doghouse.\n\nAs the Simpsons look solemnly at the remains of their house, Lisa sees Colin next to the dome. He tries to play Lisa a song on his guitar but Lisa couldn't hear him, so he writes the notes of the song onto the dome instead. Lisa shares a moment with Colin but Bart interrupts and rants \"Lisa has a boyfriend!\". She then punches him in the face and then is forced to flee with her family as [[Russ Cargill]] and his men arrive. [[Russ Cargill]], now mad with power, is determined to keep anyone from getting out of the dome and to get the Simpsons back in.\n\n===On the Run===\nWhile hiding from the EPA in Red Rash Inn (as well as having a very close call from being caught by two gay policemen who actually arrived at the Inn to make out), Marge catches Bart drinking whiskey to \"drown his sorrows\" and he announces that he misses Ned Flanders before passing out. The family later confront Homer, demanding to know why he dumped the silo into the lake. Homer admits that he never thought about his decision and apologizes to the family. To make it up, he presents them a solution which he had prepared for if he ever screwed up so badly: he proposes that the entire family move to [[Alaska]]. While Marge is hesitant at first, Homer eventually manages to get her to follow him.\n\nThe next day, the family is at a carnival, where a carny is offering his truck to someone if they can ride a motorcycle in a spherical cage once, for three tries. However, three times Homer fails, so the carny gives him another try, just to see him get hurt. Lisa advises her father to not stop when he reaches the top, enabling him to win. As the Simpsons drive off in their new truck, the carny's Siamese (as in conjoined) wives aren't very happy because the carny had forgotten that he had to take his wives on vacation.\n\nWhile stopping for gas, Marge is eventually very proud of Bart for being sober, which he proves by knocking a hot dog out of Homer's hand with his slingshot. Marge tries to tell Bart to give Homer another chance, but is cut off when she sees a wanted poster showing them. She distracts the clerk, while Bart draws over the poster to match a similar looking family who had just walked in.      \n[[File:Similar looking family who had just walked in. .jpg|thumb|The similar looking family.]]\n\nMeanwhile back in Springfield, power outages plague the surviving populance. In [[Burns Manor]], [[Julius Hibbert]], [[Clancy Wiggum]], and [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]] asked [[Waylon Smithers]] and [[Mr. Burns]] for electricity. Burns asks for good reasons to do so, or he will [[Charles Montgomery Burns|release the hounds]]. Hibbert and Wiggum want to help patients at the hospital and fry prisoners respectively, but Apu tries reasoning with Burns, only to realize he said the wrong thing when he tries appealing to the mans non existent compassion.\n\nThe Simpsons family make it to Alaska, and they get a new house, deciding to rebuild their lives there. Homer and Marge have a private moment of intimacy while getting snowed in (thanks to Bart, who causes an avalanche by clapping repeatedly outside.)\n\nIn Springfield, the situation deteriorates even further. The townspeople are about to reach the breaking point after running low on supplies, no electricity, and being cut off from the outside air for 93 days. The Springfield Book Club, led by [[Helen Lovejoy|Helen Lovejoy,]] discusses \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" repeatedly since they have no new books. [[Cookie Kwan]], [[Lindsey Naegle]], [[Bernice Hibbert]], [[Luann Van Houten]] and the others complain, and the discussion ends with Lindsey Naegle throwing her book at Helen. The book instead flies out the window and knocks out the coffee machine inside the Church at an alcoholics anonymous meeting. [[Barney Gumble]] finally snaps and runs out to make a futile attempt to crack the dome, followed by the rest of the Springfieldians, using everything from battering rams and jackhammers to shovels and boxing gloves, some efforts actually start cracking it. This is witnessed by Russ Cargill from a security camera who tells the President that they can't keep Springfield in this state forever. If they get out, then the world will know, which would mean bureaucratic investigations. Cargill asks the President to choose another plan out of five, but this time manipulates him to choose Option 4: Blow Up Springfield.\n\n===Saving Springfield===\n[[File:Download.jpg|thumb|left|310px|Alaska]]\nIn Alaska, the family is peacefully rebuilding their lives until one night they see a commercial with Tom Hanks about the \"New Grand Canyon\" being built, to be located east of [[Shelbyville]], and south of [[Capital City]]. This happens to be where Springfield is located. Marge and the kids decide that they must save Springfield, but [[File:SAM 0060.jpg|thumb|278px|The Simpsons Movie in 2-D!]]Homer refuses to help the town that tried to kill them, even after Marge repeats the same line that he used to convince her to move to Alaska and stubbornly distances himself from his family once again, even after Bart calls him a bad father. He leaves the house to play a \"Grand Theft Walrus\" arcade game at Eski-Moe's Bar and returns to the house the next day, only to discover that Marge left a video tape. She has left with the kids to save Springfield, she states that she's stood up for him after everything they've been through, but after this she's finally forgotten why she's done so for so many years and to prove she has ended their marriage, she taped over their wedding video, the message cutting off just in time for Homer to see them dancing to 'Why do birds suddenly appear'. Homer is left heartbroken and runs out to find his family, only to be mauled by a polar bear. It is chased off by an [[Medicine Woman|Inuit shaman]], who drags Homer to her hut. She tells him that he must have an epiphany and begins the art of throat [[File:Simpsons movie.jpg|thumb]]singing. Homer then enters a dreamworld, trying to find the right epiphany but is slapped, punched and kicked by \"epiphitrees\". When they pull his body apart, Homer realizes that he cannot survive without others, and must save Springfield and his family. He begins a long journey home, from driving a sled of sled dogs, who attack and leave him when they started to rest, before walking. He starts to lose hope, until a sight of the northern lights turn into the shaman, who points the direction of Springfield with her breasts.\n\nMeanwhile, Marge, Lisa, Maggie and Bart arrive at a Seattle train station to inform the world of the EPA's plot. Unknowingly, they are overheard by a robotic drone, used by the National Security Agency to spy on people's conversation and are immediately arrested by Cargill upon arrival.\n\nHomer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his handcuffs but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.\n\nThe Simpsons (minus Homer) wake up to find themselves back in Springfield, now in ruins. They find [[Moe Szyslak]], who is dressed in a bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, [[Russ Cargill]] reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing the dome over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced operation Soaring Eagle, an ill named plan which involves killing them all.[[File:IMG 00030.JPG.jpeg|thumb|\"Emperor\" Moe]] \nA helicopter arrives and opens a hole at the top of the dome, lowering a small but powerful bomb, timed at 15 minutes. As the Springfieldians panic and find cover, the family realises that they still miss [[Homer]] with Bart stating \"his big fat ass could shield us all\".\n\nIn order to save his family, Homer disguises himself as General Mariott Suites and knocks out a guard guarding the site. Homer grabs a tube of superglue, which he applies to each hand and climbs the dome himself. [[Carl]] tells everyone to climb the rope to safety while [[Cletus]] distracts him with his thumb. Unfortunately, Homer descends down the helicopter rope, knocking the escaping town people and bomb off the rope. The fall of the bomb freezes its timer in the process. Homer is upset when Bart disowns him for this and accidentally kicks down the bomb, which not only reactivates it but halves its time limit, resulting in him being berated by the townspeople again.\n\nBart finds Ned and his sons, [[Rod and Todd Flanders]] inside the Church. Bart wants to be part of Ned's Family, due to Homer's negligence towards him, and Ned decides to accept him, though Rod and Todd try to warn him not to. Homer sees Marge behind the ruins of a building and tries to get to her, but accidentally hits a tree. One of the tree's leaves point towards a motorbike. Knowing what he has to do, he rides the motorbike and grabs the bomb, determined to save Springfield. Before he does so, he finds Bart and the Flanders at the Church. Bart reconciles with Homer after he offers to let Bart hold the bomb, and they cycle up the side of the dome. While cycling around the dome the same way he did at the carnival weeks ago, Homer is about to realize his family's cycle of negligence between the relationship of father and son only to be interrupted by Marge to \"[just] throw the goddamn bomb\". When Homer reaches the top, Bart throws the bomb through the hole, mere seconds before it detonates. The explosion cracks the dome, and Homer manages to ride down from the falling pieces of the dome to the slope of Springfield Gorge, managing to make it over. The dome shatters completely into tiny harmless pieces, and everyone is saved, except [[Dr. Nick Riviera|Dr. Nick]], who is crushed by an exceptionally large piece of glass.[[File:Homer-bartx.jpg|thumb|Homer and Bart on The Motorcycle]]\n\nWhile looking at the now domeless Springfield, Cargill appears, deciding to learn the two things that Harvard doesn't teach: how to cope with defeat and how to handle a shotgun, by killing Homer, only to be knocked out by Maggie.\n\nLisa is told by [[Milhouse]] that Colin died when they were away only for him to appear afterwards. The town praises Homer, who rides off with Marge and Maggie on the motorbike into the sunset and Homer and Marge intimately kiss each other. The film ends with everyone rebuilding the Simpsons house and restoring things back to the way they were.\n\n===Credits===\nThe credits come to a pause, where we see Smithers with Mr. Burns in his looted manor, and the depressed millionaire suggests that suicide for [[Waylon Smithers]] might cheer him up sometime. The credits briefly pause again, when we see Tom Hanks asking the audience that if they see him in real life, to leave him be.\n\nWhile the credits roll, the Simpsons are (still) watching the movie in a theater. Bart needs to use the restroom, and Lisa wants to see that no animals were harmed during filming, which she does. Before they leave, Maggie says \"sequel\" (which some viewers think is a sign there will be a sequal to the movie). Then Homer picks up \"Floor Popcorn\". During the credits, the Springfield National Anthem was based on the French National anthem, La Marseillaise, due to Springfield admitting that they don't have their own anthem, and therefore they stole their tune by paying a short guy to write it, but vanished, because the French does outstanding things like making love, wine and Roquefort, Camembert and Brie cheese. At the very end of the credits, the [[Squeaky-Voiced Teen]] cleans up the floor, not thinking four years in film school was really worth it.\n\n==Opening Sequence==\nThe sequence was completely remade for ''The Simpsons Movie'' and features the orchestrated version of \"The Simpsons Theme\" as adapted by Hans Zimmer, which is slightly different from the first track of ''[[The Simpsons Movie: The Music]]'' CD. The pre-sequence scene is displayed in a 16:9 television aspect ratio, with black matte bars at either end of the screen. As the sequence begins with the \"The Simpsons\" logo appearing out of the clouds, [[Professor Frink]] flies past in one of his inventions carrying a banner marked \"MOVIE\" and saying \"Moo-vie! On the big screen!!\" (on the DVD version he says \"Moo-vie! On the small screen!) When he hits the bar on the left side, both it and the one on the right nudge out of view so that the image fills the entire screen.\n\nInstead of going through the P of \"SIMPSONS,\" the camera goes through the O of \"MOVIE\" as the banner falls loose. The camera zooms in on the town, with several major landmarks popping-up. The camera then zooms in to [[Mr. Burns]], who is holding a toothbrush in his bathroom with [[Smithers]] who gives him toothpaste, the extra weight of the toothpaste causes frail Mr. Burns to collapse. The camera then zooms past [[Moe's Tavern]] into the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] where [[Apu]] is secretly changing the expiration date on one of his products from 2006 to 2008. Next the camera cuts to Springfield Elementary where [[Jimbo]], [[Dolph]] and [[Kearney]] are hoisting [[Martin Prince]] up a flagpole by his underwear and saluting it as if it were a flag. The camera then zooms through the window where [[Bart]] is writing lines for detention (\"I will not illegally download this movie\") before finishing with [[Green Day]] who are hosting a concert at [[Lake Springfield]], playing their version of \"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons_Theme The Simpsons Theme] and using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter teleprompter] to get its \"lyrics\" right.\n\n==Behind the Laughter==\n===Production===\n*Previous ''The Simpsons'' film projects that failed to develop:\n**[[Matt Groening]] mentioned in an interview published in the Summer 1993 issue of [[Simpsons Illustrated]] that \"maybe someday we'll do a Simpsons movie\".\n**The season four episode \"[[Kamp Krusty]]\" was originally going to be a film, but difficulties were encountered in writing a movie length script, at which point the movie plans were dropped in favor of a season premiere.\n**Before his death, [[Phil Hartman]] had always wanted to create a live action [[Troy McClure]] film, with several of the staff saying that they would have loved to help create it.\n**[[Matt Groening]] expressed a wish to make ''Simpstasia'', a parody of the Disney film ''Fantasia''.\n*Production for the movie began in 2001.\n*Numerous plots were considered for this movie: [[Al Jean]] suggested the family saving manatees, which became the 2005 episode \"[[Bonfire of the Manatees]]\", and there was a ''The Truman Show''-style notion of the characters discovering their lives were a TV show, which Groening rejected due to his rule \"that the Simpsons never become aware of themselves as celebrities\", however this idea was later put in as the plot in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'' where the family discover that their lives are a video game.\n*94 characters have speaking parts.\n*Series regulars [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Marcia Wallace]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Russi Taylor]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Joe Mantegna]], and [[Maggie Roswell]] reprised their roles for the film. [[Albert Brooks]] plays [[Russ Cargill]], [[Green Day]] and [[Tom Hanks]] play themselves.\n*Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that was cut, as were Edward Norton, Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich's scenes, and [[Kelsey Grammer]]'s as [[Sideshow Bob]].\n*[[Hans Zimmer]] provided the score, ahead of regular composer [[Alf Clausen]].\n*Although credited, Patty, Selma, Edna Krabappel, Jimbo, Groundskeeper Willie, and Kang did not have speaking parts in the final cut. However, the first three had parts in the DVD's deleted scenes, and Willie is heard cheering with the other Springfieldians. Kodos was also in one version of the movie; he and Kang slated the film over the end credits, however this was cut after a test screening.\n\n===Marketing and release===\n[[File:Simpsons teaser trailer.png|right|thumb|240px|[[Homer Simpson]] sitting on his couch in a Superman t-shirt and briefs in the teaser trailer that debuted on March 31, 2006.]]\n*In [[Treehouse of Horror XVII]], first shown on November 5, 2006, in the credits executive producer Al Jean's name had the date of the release as a middle name.\n*A teaser trailer for the film was attached to the film ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' from March 31, 2006 onwards; the same trailer was then broadcast during the April 2 episode of ''The Simpsons'', \"[[Million Dollar Abie]]\".\n*In July 2006, two clips of early, black and white, unfinished animatic footage from the film were shown to audiences during a ''Simpsons'' panel at Comic-Con 2006, with a third animatic clip being released on the ''The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season'' DVD boxset.\n*A 1½-minute-long trailer was then shown on November 12, 2006, immediately after the second act of ''The Simpsons'' episode \"[[G.I.

So in November 2000, it introduced [[X-Men: Evolution]] in which the X-Men members were teenagers in the first four seasons.  However, after Season 4, the show was cancelled due to its decreased ratings.  But in the last episode [[X-Men: Evolution Season 4 9|\"Ascension\"]] , Xavier gave a quick summary of Season 5 and beyond.\n\nIn early 2008, Marvel Studios introduced Wolverine and the X-Men which was the successor of X-Men: Evolution. Not entirely based on the former, this new show loosely followed the final moments of X-Men: Evolution, including:\n\n* Logan again leaving the X-Men .\n* Rogue with long tied hair trying to stop Logan.\n* Anti-mutant Sentiment rising again.\n* The attack of Sentinels.\n* A reformed Magneto introducing a safe place for mutants-Genosha.\n* Jean with Phoenix Force.\n* Colossus and Gambit(temporarily) joining the X--Men\n* The Brotherhood remaining the same without the aid of Magneto.\n\nThe new show also went into deeper things such as:\n* Xavier going into coma and rising in future after 20 years.\n* Recruiting the X-Men once again with Wolverine as the leader.\n* Angel turning into Archangel by Mr.Sinister.\n\n\n==News==\nThe series was in the pre-production stage as of April 2007 and early news had speculated the show to air in fall 2008-<ref>[http://www.invertedstripes.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1176213186&archive=&start_from=&ucat=& New X-Men Cartoon Early Fall 2008?]</ref> due to air Summer 2008 on BBC UK<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/moviestories.1598.First_Look:_Wolverine~and~The_X-Men First Look: Wolverine & The X-Men - Marvel.com News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. However, the speculation came to a rest as according to Marvel Quarterly reports, the show is scheduled to air in Spring 2009.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=147264 MARVEL REPORTS Q4 2007 NUMBERS: PROFIT MORE THAN DOUBLES - NEWSARAMA]</ref> It was also confirmed in an article by USA TODAY's website in which it specifically mentions the cartoon starting in early 2009 on Nicktoons Network.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-03-17-marvel-nicktoons_N.htm]</ref>\n\nAs of April 15th, 2010, Marvel Animation Age confirmed there will be no second season due to lack of funding.<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=518]</ref> Whether or not the series is through or not is unknown, and reasons for the confirmation are still not publicly known. \n\n==Production team==\nWolverine and the X-Men is the direct follow-up to the fourth season of [[X-Men: Evolution]] the same creative team behind the show is returning to work on the new cartoon. Steven E Gordon, Greg Johnson, and Boyd Kirkland have all returned to work on this new series.\n\n==Story==\nAfter an attack on the mansion, [[Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Jean Grey]] are missing. The X-Men disband and Scott begins to suffer from depression. [[Emma Frost]] is able to locate a comatose Charles on [[Genosha]] in the care of Magneto. Professor X telepathically orders [[Wolverine]] to lead the [[X-Men]] and set out to save the world from The [[Sentinel]] Project and prevent the Brotherhood of Mutants from taking over the world before the future ends up a bad one.\n\nThe series begins with Wolverine saying good-byes to the X-men, as he has done many times. He leaves Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and Colossus in the Danger Room as his good-bye to them. He then tries to talk to Rogue who is oddly distant and distraught over his departure. Cyclops and Jean Grey are arguing about Scott owing Wolverine an apology (for what, is not revealed). As Wolverine approaches Charles Xavier with Storm, the Professor cringes in pain as does Jean. There is a sudden blasts and Wolverine awakes one year later from napping under a tree.\n\nAs he is on his motorcycle, there is an explosion in the distance. He rushes to the site where several RVs have collided with a train in a fiery blaze. A child is trapped inside the flames and Wolverine rushes in to rescue the child. As he reaches her, the trains explode again. As the rescue crews uncover more debris, they find Wolverine (referring to him as \"it\" for being a mutant) and the girl under him, safe from the blast. The girl's father rushes to aid Wolverine to the dismay and fear of the crowd. A man in the crowd, the father's neighbor, has called the MRD (Mutant Response Division, a government-sponsored military force that captures \"unregistered\" mutants regardless of status, violent or non-violent, with excessive force and a large supply of military hardware) to arrest \"it\" because he's a wanted mutant. The father takes his family and Wolverine to his home to care for him. To their surprise, Wolverine's wounds heal and they are thankful since Wolverine would most likely not be welcomed at a hospital. \n\nSoon, the MRD arrive at the house, barging in through the front door, armed with heavy weapons. They arrest the family for harboring a mutant and Wolverine battles the MRD forces for a short while, but the MRD escapes with the family. \n\nWolverine returns to the remains of the Xavier Institute and enters an underground chamber where Dr. Hank McCoy, aka Beast, is working. Beast states that he cannot determine what caused the blast that destroyed the institute, but it was centered on Charles' position. However, he cannot determine what caused it. Wolverine informs Beast of the arrest of the family and wants to free them. Beast is surprised and disgruntled that the MRD is arresting non-mutants without charge as well as mutants. \n\nBeast and Wolverine infiltrate the MRD compound and release the captives which include the family, Dust, Rockslide, Boom-Boom, Wolfsbane and Pyro. The mutants part ways and Wolverine sees the family off, but both Wolverine and Beast are concerned that the MRD prison compound will be filled with more mutants shortly. They then agree to bring back the X-men.\n\nIceman aka Bobby Drake joins the X-men against the will of his parents. Angel aka Warren Worthington III is unable to join the X-men because of his father's alliance with Senator Robert Kelly, proponent of the MRD. Colossus aka Piotr Rasputin refuses to abandon his family again. Rogue is too annoyed with the X-men and ends up joining the Brotherhood instead (consisting of Blob, Toad, Avalanche, Domino, and Quicksilver). Nightcrawler is nowhere to be found. Cyclops is still depressed over Jean's disappearance. However, the X-men are able to locate Kitty Pride aka Shadowcat on her way to Genosha.\n\nAfter a trap to make the X-men look like assassins against Senator Kelly, the Mutant Registration Act passes, thanks to Rogue's betrayal and the Brotherhood's assistance. With that, Angel relocates funds towards the Xavier Institute to rebuild the mansion, the X-jet, the Danger Room and Cerebro with the help of Forge, who is the X-men's technician. \n\nThe need for a telepath surmounts the animosity toward her, so Emma Frost is brought onto the team. With her assistance, they find Xavier on Genosha. Cylcops joins the team after being informed that Charles is still alive. Throughout the series, Magneto advertises Genosha where there is equality, freedom, and acceptance for mutants. The attack on Magneto fails and he reveals that Xavier washed up on the shores of Genosha in a coma. \n\nXavier appears from the future, with a message that in twenty years, the MRD has become immensely powerful, issuing the full Sentinel program as seen in comic book series. Mutants are hunted like animals by machines while the city is in ruins. Xavier states that the X-men must stay together under the leadership of Wolverine in order to prevent the post-apocalyptic future from happening. Cyclops was asked to stay even if he wasn't a leader and if he wasn't with Jean. \n\nCharles warns Wolverine that Africa has been destroyed by Storm some how and Wolverine and his team must act to stop it. After a battle with an alternate version of Shadow King, Storm rejoins the X-men after she is shown his coma-state after Frost successfully frees Storm from his control. \n\nGambit appears as a member of the Thieves' Guild who tries to steal a mutant power inhibitor for the MRD, but is stopped by Wolverine after a battle at the Sentinel Prowler factory. \n\nNightcrawler meanwhile boarded a cargo ship illegally transporting mutants to Genosha and battles the crew to protect the mutants from abuse. A pirate ship arrives with Spiral and the Reavers, under the command of Mojo, who try to sink the ship. Nightcrawler single-handedly takes down the Reavers and force them into retreat after repairing the cargo ship and sinking the Reavers'. Then, the X-men arrive, asking Nightcrawler to join, but he wants to assure the mutants' safe passage to Genosha. Nightcrawler finally arrives on Genosha and is treated to a guided tour by the Scarlet Witch who shows the best Genosha has to offer.  However, this is a facade that Nightcrawler pierces with the help of Dust.  He tries to escape only to be recaptured by Mystique, posing as Wolverine, just as he reaches the mansion.\n\nBesides the funding the Sentinel program, Angel's father is also researching a \"cure\" for mutation, treating it as a genetic disease.  Upon learning this, Angel breaks with his father and starts acting in the open as an X-Men. This leads to a conflict with the MRDs who in the process of capturing Angel, break his wings.  Rather than call in an Avian specialist, Angel's father orders the doctors to cut off the wings.  This leads to extreme depression to Angel who, grasping at any options, allows Sinister to give him his wings back -- turning Angel into Archangel, a mind-controlled servant of Sinister.\n\nThe last remaining piece of this conflict is finally revealed as Jean Grey is found in a hospital with amnesia. After a nurse inadvertently stresses Jean trying to find her memory, Jean responds with a reflexive telekinetic push. The nurse, another mutant hater, calls in the MRD at the same time as Emma Frost senses Jean's return. She and Scott leave the mansion to find Jean. The MRD get to Jean first, and frighten her so badly that she lashes out, knocking out every person within hundreds of miles. Emma partially blocks the assault so she revives first, and uses telepathy to revive Scott. Scott and Emma reach Jean at the same time as Archangel arrives. A running battle ends with the X-Men knocked unconscious and Archangel returning to Sinister with Jean and Scott. Emma regroups with the X-Men and is able to retrieve both Jean and Cyclops, fighting off Archangel and other minions of Sinister.\n\nThe victory is short lived, however. Shortly upon her return to the mansion, Jean is once again kidnapped, this time by none other than Emma Frost herself as an agent of the Hellfire Club. Knocking out all the X-Men telepathically, she attempts to feign ignorance when they revive of her knowledge of the kidnapping, but is caged by Wolverine, only to be released by Cyclops who still believes she is trying to help rescue Jean. The Hellfire Club wants Jean because they want to liberate and harness the Phoenix energy she has, all except Emma Frost, who wants to dissipate the energy as it is too dangerous to be controlled. She tries to take Jean back with the help of Scott, but the Hellfire Club stops them and transfers the Phoenix force to a quintet of blonde teen psychics named as the Stepford Cuckoos.\n\nWhile all this is going on, Magneto has Mystique capture Senator Kelly, replace him, and institute an immediate attack with all available Sentinel forces on Genosha, despite efforts by the X-Men to prevent the launch.  By faking a human attack on Genosha, one he can defeat, he seeks to galvanize mutants across the world in a popular uprising against humans, thereby having Genosha spread past its borders.  When the Scarlet Witch learns of his plans from Nightcrawler, she and Lorna both abandons Magneto.  \n\nThis does not stop Magneto from defeating the Sentinels and reprogramming them for an assault on New York City. Fighting valiantly, the X-Men are unable to stop all the Sentinels, but the Phoenix force under the nominal control of the Stepford Cuckoos attack and destroy the remaining Sentinels, and defeat Magneto before Emma, Jean, and Scott work in concert to lure the Phoenix force out of Stepford Cuckoos and into Emma in her crystalline form. It is unclear if Emma, in her crystalline form lacks the telepathy to contain the Phoenix force, or if it was a conscious decision by Emma, that leads to Emma being shattered.  The shattering releases the Phoenix force where it dissipates, while fragments of crystal Emma to rain down on the city.\n\nAt the end of the first Season, the X-Men are now Wolverine, Cyclops, Shadowcat, Iceman, Beast, Storm, Nightcrawler, Forge, and Jean Grey.  Emma Frost is shattered crystal and presumably dead while Angel remains Archangel, still in thrall to Sinister.\n\n===In The Future===\n\nCharles Xavier awakes 20 years in the future from his coma to see that the world has become a desolate wasteland where Sentinels, manufactured by Mastermold, hunt down any and all mutants without discretion. Surrounding the remains of the Xavier Institute are tombstones for each and every one of the X-men.\n\nAfrica is a lifeless continent after Storm was tricked by Shadow King, but Xavier was able to warn the X-men in the past about this possible event.\n\nUsing Cerebro, Xavier is able to frequently communicate with the X-men in the past. While transmitting however, Sentinels locate Xavier and capture both him and Cerebro itself in order to find many mutants. At the processing facility, human agents are enhanced physically with cybernetic implants that can override the biological components. The facilities are mostly automated and force mutants to wear a mutant inhibitor bands while simultaneously try to duplicate their powers by force.\n\nXavier and Bishop together are able to liberate the facility with Cerebro, establishing a new team of X-men in the future consisting of Bishop, Marrow, Firestar, Hellion, and Domino.\n\nAll the X-Men are praised for their actions by Professor Xavier for stoping the future war and the Sentinels, but are warned of a new danger approaching: the Age of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-80920)|Apocalypse]].\n\n}}\n\n\n==Characters==\n===X-Men===\n<gallery>\nJames Howlett (Earth-8096) 00.png|[[James Howlett (Earth-8096)|Wolverine]], James Howlett\nCyclops-1-.png|[[Scott Summers

In it, he finds Spiderwick's field guide to faeries; although an attached note warns him not to read it, he does so anyway.\n\nSoon after, Jared meets a brownie named Thimbletack ([[Martin Short]]), who explains that magical creatures are normally invisible, but can reveal themselves at will. He tells Jared about a protective circle that Arthur Spiderwick placed around the house and gives him a stone with a hole through which he can see faeries.\n\nHowever, a shape-shifting ogre named Mulgarath ([[Nick Nolte]]) wants the field guide for himself so he can rule over all faerie-kind. He sends his goblins led by Redcap the Pompous Goblin General, to obtain it, and they kidnap Simon, mistaking him for Jared. Meanwhile, Jared meets Hogsqueal ([[Seth Rogen]]), a hobgoblin and bitter enemy of Mulgarath. Hogsqueal gives Jared the ability to see faeries without the aid of the stone. Mulgarath lets Simon go and berates Redcap for failing his master. But soon Jared, who is hiding, is spotted by the goblins. Together, the twins flee to the house, managing to escape only with Mallory's help.\n\nThe children decide to visit their great-aunt Lucinda, now in a psychiatric hospital, for advice. While Simon distracts the goblins, Mallory and Jared manage to reach a tunnel under the estate. Lucinda tells them that they need to find Arthur Spiderwick and have him destroy the book; however, Arthur is being held captive by Sylphs, a type of faerie. Suddenly, Mulgarath's goblins attack them and steal several pages from the book before they are driven off. Meanwhile in the woods, Mulgarath berates Redcap violently for not bringing all of the book, but he is pleased by having a page that allows Mulgarth to break the protective circle by moonrise. Mulgarath and Redcap prepare the potion for the upcoming night. Meanwhile on the children's return, Hogsqueal warns them that one of the stolen pages will allow Mulgarath to destroy the protective circle when the moon rises.\n\nJared and Simon, along with Mallory use the book to summon Arthur Spiderwick's pet, a griffin, which takes them to the realm of the Sylphs. There they meet Arthur, who has not aged but is also unaware of the time he has spent there. After returning home again, Jared, Simon, Mallory, and Helen arm themselves with steel knives and home-made bombs prepared by Simon. When they are forced into the kitchen, they place all of their bombs into the oven, detonating them and killing all of the goblins and Redcap.\n\nMr. Grace ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) enters the house and tells Jared that he came to apologize. Jared, realizing that it is not his father, stabs him in the stomach, revealing him to be Mulgarath in disguise. Jared escapes with the book through the dumbwaiter while Mulgarath gives pursuit. On the roof, Jared throws the book onto the lawn; as Mulgarath transforms into a raven to catch it, he is snatched and eaten by Hogsqueal.\n\nThe Graces bring Lucinda back to the house, and the Sylphs appear, bringing Arthur. He cannot remain outside of the faerie realm, but Lucinda asks to be taken with him instead; the Sylphs transform her back into her six-year-old self and spirit the two away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as Jared/Simon Grace; Jared is the main protagonist and a young boy with anger problems, and is the most reluctant about moving from New York.

She said that she \"was in front of the blue screen like 24 hours a day\", and for the most part, she was \"kicking and slicing and chopping things that were nowhere near\".

    "wikiText": "{{Theorytabtop}}\n==From Lost==\n* This is the only item of food that is not contained or wrapped in a black and white [[Dharma Initiative]] covering, and is therefore not made by Dharma, but a business partner.\n* [[Apollo]] Candy Bars are found in the [[Swan]]. This also has relevance in mythology.  Look at this quote: \"Sacred to Apollo are the swan (one legend says that Apollo flew on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans, he would spend the winter months among them)\" \n** [[The Swan]] is not the only reference: the [[Four-Toed Statue|Statue]] seems to date to the Greco-Roman times, just around the time of Apollo. This statue may be a tribute to him, later destroyed by the movement of the [[Dharma Initiative]]. The Hyperboreans, moreover, were - according to Julius Evola - the inhabitants of Atlantis, and this could be a proof of the [[Lost Continent]] theory. \n* It was the candy bar that [[Boone]] offered [[Shannon]] in {{ep|1x01}}.\n* [[Apollo]]'s mother Leto gave birth to Apollo on the newly created floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island. The island was surrounded by swans. This links back to the idea of the island being \"mobile\" and also it is another link to the [[swan]]. \n*  Also, on the island of Delos, I believe no child was allowed to be born there once Apollo had been born there. Artemis was later brought there, but only Apollo was actually born on Delos.\n*[[Ben]] and [[Hurley]] shared an Apollo Bar while waiting for [[Locke]] to emerge from [[Jacob]]'s [[Cabin]] in \"[[Cabin Fever]]\". When he came out he announced that they must move [[The Island]] to save it.\n* There's something extra in them, nutrition-wise or something having to do with DHARMA experimentation. Maybe a longevity agent or something that alters behavior. It causes people to see things or hallucinations. This Theory can be supported.\n*# Kate ate a Apollo Bar and saw a horse a few days later.\n*# Ben ate a Apollo Bar and saw his Mother sometime later.\n*# [[Hurley]] ate a Apollo Bar and saw Dave a few days later.\n* I read somewhere that during one of the ARGs, the head of the Apollo candy company was revealed to have been involved with psychotropic drug research, but I can't find the source right now.  Still, would explain the hallucinations.\n\n==From The Lost Experience==\n* In Greek Mythology, the oracle predicts the future, and after a certain number of oracle bars are found, [[Alvar]]'s location will be predicted. This fits with the Greek mythology theme of ''[[The Lost Experience]]'', with Apollo and [[Persephone]]. \n* Apollo Bars are made with an unknown contaminant. [[Rachel Blake]], who is in fact apart of the [[Hanso Foundation]] and a traitor, informs the public of Hanso's \"Plan\", builds and organizes a resistance of those who oppose the [[Hanso Foundation]] and uses that trust to direct them to get the Apollo bars. \"Once enough people have uploaded, the 'Truth' will be revealed\"... Apollo Bars are being used by Hanso as a vehicle to infect the population. \n* Given [[Dr. Hackett]]'s involvement with Apollo, the candy bar could be a delivery system for some sort of drug which keeps hatchlings compliant.",

It is the first game in the [[Super Smash Bros. (universe)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]]. It was followed by ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' for the Nintendo GameCube in 2001, who followed ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' for the Wii on 2008, who in turn will be succeeded by ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' for their respective consoles, expected for a release in 2014.

The series is getting \"rebooted\" with ''[[Super Smash Flash 2]]'' which actually incorporate more accurate elements of the ''SSB'' series. Several stuff from the original ''SSB'' has been added into ''SSF2'', which includes a better rendition of Kirby's stage {{SSF2|Dream Land}} and the return of [[Sector Z]], several audio effects from ''SSB'' have been kept intact in ''SSF2'' including some hit effects, [[Hitmonlee]] also returns as [[Poké Ball]] Pokémon, having exactly the same behaviour.\n[[Category:Official Games]]\n[[Category:Super Smash Bros. universe]]",

He then became the Dark Lord of the Sith, the Sith Emperor and the Ruler of the Galaxy. He lived for 600 years, ruling the Galaxy with an ion fist. His Sith Empire had conquered all of the Star systems near Korriban under Marka's orders. After all of those 6 centuries, Ragnos unfortunatly passed away, and the Golden Age of the Sith was near devastated without him.

Their struggle nearly resulted in a civil war that would have torn the Sith apart before they ever even threatened the Jedi and the Republic, which is why Ragnos' spirit appeared before the two and ended their battle and ordered them to band together if the Sith Empire was to remain in balance before returning to his grave. Sadow eventually killed Simus and Kressh and became Ragnos' successor and the new Sith Emperor and Dark Lord.\n\nAfter the death of Sadow and the rise of the reborn Sith Empire on Dromound Kaas, Ragnos' spirit came before [[Sith Emperor|the reborn Sith Empire's Sith Emperor]] and christened him the new Dark Lord and titled him as Darth Vitiate. Centuries after that, Lord Ragnos christened and marked [[Exar Kun]] and Ulic Qel-Droma as the new Dark Lords through a vision of him in 2 powerful Sith amulets and then dissappeared.\nThe spirit of Darth Marka Ragnos still lives on to this day in his tomb on Korriban, alive...\n\nRagnos also appeared in later sequels ''Tales of the Jedi'' comic series as well as being mentioned in the video games ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I and II: The Sith Lords, ''where his tomb also appeared in the two games of KOTOR.\n\n{{Star Wars Villains}}\n[[Category:Star Wars Villains]]\n[[Category:Dark Lord]]\n[[Category:Comic Book Villains]]\n[[Category:Ghosts]]\n[[Category:Master Manipulator]]\n[[Category:Cult Leaders]]\n[[Category:Dark Messiah]]\n[[Category:Male Villains]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Muses]]\n[[Category:Possessor]]\n[[Category:Evil from the past]]\n[[Category:Evil Genius]]\n[[Category:Evil Ruler]]\n[[Category:Revived Villains]]\n[[Category:Empowered Villains]]\n[[Category:Live Action Villains]]\n[[Category:Living Villains]]\n[[Category:Imprisoned Villains]]\n[[Category:Swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Video Game Villains]]\n[[Category:Corrupting Influence]]\n[[Category:Fearmongers]]\n[[Category:Recurring villain]]\n[[Category:Alchemists]]\n[[Category:Warlords]]\n[[Category:Staff Wielders]]\n[[Category:Posthumous Villains]]\n[[Category:Mass Murderer]]\n[[Category:Murderer]]\n[[Category:Destroyer of Innocence]]\n[[Category:Destroyers]]\n[[Category:Dark Forms]]\n[[Category:Dark Knights]]\n[[Category:Sadists]]\n[[Category:Evil Creator]]\n[[Category:Archenemy]]\n[[Category:Emotionless Villains]]\n[[Category:Seeker Of Vengeance]]\n[[Category:Big Bads]]\n[[Category:Bigger Bads]]\n[[Category:Deities]]\n[[Category:Fighter]]\n[[Category:Demon]]\n[[Category:Dark Priests]]\n[[Category:Mastermind]]\n[[Category:Master Orator]]\n[[Category:Misanthropes]]\n[[Category:Hatemongers]]\n[[Category:Warmonger]]\n[[Category:Torturer]]\n[[Category:Dictator]]\n[[Category:Monsters]]\n[[Category:Villains with Superhuman Strength]]\n[[Category:Brutes]]\n[[Category:Slavedrivers]]\n[[Category:Supernatural]]\n[[Category:Harbingers]]\n[[Category:Lawful Evil]]\n[[Category:Immortals]]\n[[Category:Umbrakinetic Villains]]\n[[Category:Hegemony]]",

Voyager&trade;]]'' is crippled and trapped in a veritable Saragasso Sea of space, the crew find themselves threatened by a mysterious and deadly force, and robbed by a similarly stranded [[Borg]] ship. His options limited, [[Tuvok]], ''U.S.S. Voyager''{{'}}s [[Security Officer]], sends a hand-picked Hazard Team to the [[Borg cube]] to reclaim the ship's stolen property.''\n\n:''The Hazard Team is ''Voyager''{{'}}s equivalent of a SEAL or SWAT team - the toughest and bravest from a shipful of the strong and the brave. But an excursion to the stranded Borg cube is just the first of many trials that will eventually pit them against an incredibly powerful enemy, The Forge, and The Forge's homegrown army of killers.''\n\n:''Based on material from the new [[Activision]]/[[Raven Software]] computer game, ''STAR TREK: VOYAGER - ELITE FORCE'' introduces a new crew of commandos who learn that sometimes winning a battle requires teaming with unexpected allies - and that the price of victory may be higher than they want to pay!''\n{{review}}\n\n== Summary ==\n\n:\"''[[Captain's log]], [[stardate]] 53854.7, our attempt to sneak past the [[Borg]] in this [[sector]] has ''failed''. We have no choice but to ''counter-attack'' to buy ourselves breathing space. [[Seven of Nine]] has configured a way to [[Transporter|transport]] a ''Hazard Team'' aboard the Borg cube attacking us. Their mission is to plant [[explosive]]s that will disable it long enough for ''Voyager'' to make a run to safety. No one said such a mission would be ''easy'', but from the sounds of their last communication... I fear it is nothing short of ''impossible!''\"\n\n[[File:Elite Force comic - Borg.jpg|thumb|The Hazard Team fights off the Borg]]\nOn a Borg cube, [[Ensign]] Munro, second in command of the Hazard Team, is fighting off the encroaching [[Borg drone]]s with the help of his squad - Austin Chang, Telsia Murphy, Rick Beissman, and a now unconscious [[Chell]]. Beissman, hitting Borg left and right and armed with two [[phaser]]s, is almost enjoying himself until a Borg grabs him from behind and drags him away to be [[assimilated]]. Chang jumps to his rescue but is [[stun]]ned by some kind of energy pulse fired by one of the drones. Just as Murphy and Munro say their final farewells, a bolt of energy knocks out several of the drones. [[Lieutenant]] Foster, leader of the Hazard Team, explains that it is \"an I-MOD\" (Infinity Modulator) which changes modulation after every shot so that the Borg can't adapt. But while Foster is boasting, he also is captured by the Borg. Munro grabs the I-MOD, and the Borg capture Murphy. After outrunning them, Munro falls down into a chamber where his former teammates, now assimilated, try to assimilate him. Claiming he could never shoot them, Munro does nothing.  Tuvok ends the confrontation - and the [[holodeck]] program - by saying \"End [[Simulation]].\"\n\nTuvok tells Munro that he has failed to follow Hazard Team procedure, and thereby the simulation. Munro argues that it was impossible for him to fire on his own people, but Tuvok tells him someday he will be asked to do the impossible, and to consider this his own \"[[Kobayashi Maru scenario|Kobayashi Maru]].\"\n\nIn the [[briefing room]], [[Commander]] Tuvok points out the mistakes each team member made, but is interrupted when the ship is jolted by weapons fire.\n\nOn the [[bridge]], [[Captain]] [[Kathryn Janeway|Janeway]] orders all hands to battle stations. After the unknown vessel doesn't answer [[hail]]s she orders her crew to return fire. But phasers have no effect, and as ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[shields]] are about to fail [[Tom Paris|Tom]] launches a full spread of [[photon torpedo]]es. The torpedoes strike a direct hit, but the alien ship begins to explode much more than the torpedoes should have caused. A gigantic shock wave hits ''Voyager'', and suddenly there is nothing seen on the viewscreen but stars.\n\n''Voyager'' has instantly appeared somewhere else, in an apparent graveyard of ships. Janeway begins to order that they start repairs until they can figure out where they are, when a Borg cube begins heading their way. Janeway tells the Hazard Team to be on alert, as the Borg will probably try to board them. As Beissman is about to make a snide remark in [[Main Engineering]], a group of Borg beam in. Before anyone can do anything, they begin putting tags on ship components- consoles, panels, processors - and beaming them to their ship. As the Hazard Team finally gets a shot in, a Borg grabs Foster by the neck, and they all return to their ship - components as well.\n\nReports show that four crewmen were taken, as well as all the [[Isolinear circuitry|isolinear modules]]. Scans show another ship is approaching, but slowly. So Janeway has Seven meet her in the [[Brig]] to interrogate one of the Borg they captured while they attempt repairs. Seven uses her connection to the Borg to find that they are trapped in an \"null-entropy chasm,\" constructed by \"the Forge.\"\n\nJaneway has the Hazard Team suit up to board the cube to retrieve the materials. Armed with the new I-MODs, and joined by Seven, they beam aboard in two teams of 3. All is going well until several of the components have been reclaimed, and the Borg begin attacking. While the team fends them off, Chell gets the last component and Seven connects to the hive mind. Just as the Foster-drone appears, Seven brings down the shields. Before Munro can fire, he has ''Voyager'' beam them back. \n\n:\"''Captain's log, supplemental- The so-called ''Harvester'' is on its final approach towards us. It doubtless anticipates more ''easy'' prey ... a stricken ship without drive or weapons. But we have used the time it has taken to reach us to effect emergency repairs. We have enough ''[[Impulse engine|impulse power]]'' to avoid its clutching gravimetric tractors ... and enough ''phaser capacity'' to surprise it. And ''wound'' it. We may have hurt it badly or it may simply be, as Mr. Tuvok suggests, that our resistance has ''confused'' its simple preprogrammed mission. Whatever the case, it turns and retreats, back towards this mysterious \"Forge\" that sent it. Within seconds, it is outstripping our best available speed. But we have taken our chance, and in the brief instant its shields were down... managed to beam four members of the Hazard Team aboard.''\"\n\nClawed [[insect]]-like aliens crowd and attack the Hazard Team on the ''Harvester'', but they fend them off. Exploring the ship, the team discovers that the deeper they go the more advanced the aliens - dubbed the harvesters - seem to get. The next set are able to walk on their hind legs, and one kills Beissman. Fortunately, the remaining team members are rescued by a team led by Tuvok that beams aboard. With teams located all around the structure, they continue to search for its purpose. But they are soon interrupted by an extremely powerful [[Telepathy|telepathic]] entity that overloads all their minds, bringing them to their knees. The entity tells them to get out now, and explains that his purpose has been to take materials from ships that get caught in the chasm to build an army, similar to the Borg, and that his purpose is to conquer the entire [[Milky Way Galaxy|galaxy]].\n\n[[File:Elite force - Tarlus.jpg|thumb|The Tarlus threaten to conquer the galaxy]]\nRecovering, the teams set charges throughout the ship. Murphy, Munro and Chell find the entity, which tells them that the Tarlus will rule the galaxy, and he is doing their bidding. Alex tries to reason with it, but the situation once again breaks out into a firefight. With the three of them trapped against a wall, they are truly surprised to see their saviors transport in: the Borg. Led by the Foster-drone, the Borg assist and together they defeat the Forge. The Foster-drone tells Munro that the collective has analyzed the individual known as ''Foster''s memory, and concluded that their the collective is reliant on ''Voyager''{{'}}s survival, which is reliant on Munro's. \n\nThe teams beam back to ''Voyager'' and the charges are blown. They also fire a full spread of torpedoes, and the Borg join in the effort. The structure explodes, with the result that both ships are returned to normal space. [[Harry Kim|Harry]] reports that they have emerged two years closer to home. In light of his excellent leadership during the crisis, Janeway has Munro promoted to both Lieutenant and head of the Hazard Team.\n\n== Memorable Quotes ==\n\"''Where are the freaking Borg? I hate this creeping around when I could be kicking Borg butt. Uh... No offense ma'am. I mean... as Borg butt goes... you got...''\"<br />\n\"''Don't dig yourself in any deeper Mr. Beissman.''\"\n: - '''Mr. Beissman''' and '''Seven of Nine'''\n\n\n\"''Apparently, here captain.''\"\n: - '''Tuvok''', responding to \"where had ''Voyager'' been transported\" in more general terms than usual\n\n\n\"''Watch my back, Mr. Beissman.''\"<br />\n\"''My pleasure.''\"<br />\n\"''That hole you're digging Beissman, it's getting deeper.''\"\n: - '''Seven of Nine''',''' Mr. Beissman'''\n\n\n\"''I've seldom seen Tuvok so animated.''\"\n: - '''Captain Janeway''', after Tuvok had complimented Munro on a job well done\n\n== Background Information ==\n* The comic abridges most of the game's story, and focuses on the [[Borg]] rather than the Forge masters.\n* At the end of the story is a \"Letter From the Editor\", [[Jeff Mariotte]], explaining that this is the first time they've tried to cross a ''[[Star Trek]]'' story from one medium to another (game to comic) at the company, and that the game need not be played to enjoy the comic, and vice versa.\n* The last three pages of the comic have pinups of early art designs, such as an early version of The Forge which looks much more humanoid (almost ancient [[Egypt]]ion) and early designs for Hazard Team members. One panel has Munro as a \"[[Lieutenant junior grade]]\" instead of a full Lieutenant, as in the story.\n* Similar to the rumored ''Millennium Falcon'' in {{film|8}}, several ''Star Wars'' ships seem to have found their way into the null-entropy chasm: When ''Voyager'' first appears, half of an ''{{w|Imperial Shuttle|Imperial Shuttle}}'' can be seen. On the page starting with \"Captain's log, supplemental\" a ''{{w|Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer}}'' can be seen.\n* Neither [[Neelix]] nor [[The Doctor]] appear in the comic book, though both appear several times in the video game.\n* The cover portrays two different ships on the left and right of the Hazard Team from the game, neither of which appear in the comic.\n* The comic offers special thanks to \"Paula Block, Laird M. Malamed, and Brian Pelletier.\"\n* The story bears remarkable similarities to {{TAS|The Time Trap}}, in which the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} is '''also''' transported to a vast \"Saragasso Sea\" in space with numerous dead and dying ships.  As here, cooperation with a group typically hostile to the Federation - in that case the [[Klingon]]s - is required to escape.  And - ironically given that this later version is a comic book - the animated episode itself has similarities to a [[Gold Key TOS]] Star Trek comic book: Issue #15 \"[[Museum at the End of Time]]\" dated {{m|August|1972}}.\n* A special edition version of the comic packaged with the game also contains the one-shot story \"[[False Colors]]\".\n* This comic was collected as part of the trade paperback \"[[Encounters With the Unknown]]\".\n\n=== Errors ===\n* '''Grammatical:''' In the opening Captain's log, the page reads \"Seven of Nine has configured away...\" not \"a way\", as it should.\n* '''Graphic/Dialogue:''' During the initial fight scene, Munro's speech bubble incorrectly reads \"Been nice knowing you, Munro...\" and Murphy's reads \"Chang's gone too, Murphy. Just you and me now.\"\n* '''Graphic/Dialogue:''' When the Borg are beaming consoles out of Engineering, Lt. Foster fires at a Borg with implants over most of its head, including both eyes. In the next panel, the same Borg is shown with far fewer implants, over only one eye.\n* '''Graphic/Dialogue:''' Tuvok says that a majority of the crew (\"capable of using an I-MOD\") had beamed aboard the Forge's station. Then Commander Chakotay is shown on the bridge while Captain Janeway says something. Later, Chakotay is shown beaming back aboard ''Voyager'' and walking to his station, despite the fact he apparently wasn't on the away team.\n\n=== Creators ===\n* Based on:\n** ''[[Star Trek]]'' created by [[Gene Roddenberry]]\n** ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' created by [[Rick Berman]], [[Michael Piller]], and [[Jeri Taylor]]\n** [[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force|The first-person shooter game of the same name]], developed by [[Raven Software]] and published by [[Activision]]\n* Writers:\n** [[Dan Abnett]]\n** [[Andy Lanning]]\n* Artists:\n** [[Jeffrey Moy]] (pencil art - interior and cover)\n** [[W.C.

''(See Background Information, Errors)''\n;[[Tuvok]] : Creator of the Hazard Team, and ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Chief of Security]]. He observes and critiques the Hazard Teams simulations, as well as going on several of their missions with them.\n;[[Tom Paris]] : ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Helmsman]], piloted during the battle with the unknown ship, as well as firing torpedoes.\n;[[Harry Kim]] : ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Operations officer]], happy to report that they had returned to normal space 2 years closer to home.\n;[[B'Elanna Torres]] : [[Chief Engineer]], she was knocked unconscious when the Borg first beamed aboard. While the Hazard Team was aboard the Borg cube, she was hurried to repair the few ships systems she could.\n;[[Seven of Nine]] : Former Borg drone, she assisted the Hazard Team on several of their missions involving them. Was able to seemingly telepathically join with a Borg held in custody to retrieve information. She later fought along side the Hazard Team aboard the cube, to retrieve the stolen materials.\n\n=== Hazard Team ===\n;Alexander Munro : Ensign in the Security department, he was close friends with Lieutenant Foster. Initially couldn't make the tough decisions of command, such as in a [[Holodeck]] simulation, but once he gets over it Lt. Tuvok promotes him to Lieutenant, and leader of the Hazard Team. \n;Rick Beissman : Trigger-happy Hazard Team member, and possible engineer, he enjoys fighting ''Voyager''{{'}}s enemies. In the simulation, he was noted for having used the most ammo, while having fewest hits. Unfortunately he often underestimates his opponent because of his cockiness - such as when he was killed by what he thought was just a \"big bug in a jar.\"\n;Austin Chang : Hazard Team member, his only mistake in the simulation was that he tried to save Beissman, which got him assimilated as well.\n;[[Chell]] : [[Bolian]] [[engineer]], and former [[Maquis]], he serves as technician on the Hazard Team. In the simulation, he didn't check an inspection panel for booby traps and was knocked unconscious.\n;Telsia Murphy : Hazard Team medic, she was the only one who received a passing grade on the simulation (except for also being assimilated). She is close friends with Alex Munro.\n::''In the videogame, a romantic relationship is a secondary plot line in the story between her and Munro, but is only slightly hinted at when they are near death in the comic. In the video game, [[Jarot|Jurot]] is the teams medic, and as she doesn't appear in the comic, it seems the two characters were combined to make this Telsia.''\n;Lieutenant Foster : Head of the Hazard team, selected by Tuvok as the best of the best, he organized the missions and simulations (with Tuvok's assistance) until he was assimilated by the Borg when they beamed aboard. \n\n=== Other ===\n;The Forge : A creation of the Tarlus, he was ordered to create an immense army in the chasm of space using stolen parts from ships trapped there to one day take over the galaxy. When Munro tried to reason that he'd been there for centuries, maybe his orders had degraded, the Forge didn't even consider it. He was destroyed by the combined fire of the Borg and the Hazard Team.\n\n== References ==\n[[File:Borc cube orbits Earth, remastered.jpg|thumb|A Borg Cube]]\n;[[Borg]] : The Borg are first used in a simulation, and then a real mission when they are the first ship to show signs of life in the entropy. Later the Borg come to Munro and the Team's rescue aboard The Forge's station, assisting in destroying it to get out.\n\n;[[Spatial anomaly]] : The Null-Entropy Chasm is a mini-universe in space created by The Forge to conceal the building of his army, which if ''Voyager'' had not stopped, would eventually attempt to overtake the Galaxy.\n\n;[[Photon torpedo]] : After phasers don't work, Tuvok suggests a spread of photon torpedoes to destroy the unknown ship. Later they are also used to destroy the Forge's station.\n\n;[[Kobayashi Maru scenario|Kobayashi Maru]] : A popular [[Starfleet Academy]] simulation, where the player is given an impossible scenario to overcome. Tuvok calls Munro's not being able to shoot his assimilated team mate his personal \"''Kobayashi Maru''.\"\n\n[[File:USS_Voyager,_ventral_view.jpg|thumb|''Voyager''.]]\n;{{USS|Voyager}} : {{class|Intrepid}} [[Federation]] starship trapped in the [[Delta Quadrant]]. Loses 4 crewmen in the attacks, armed with photon torpedoes and phasers. Crew of approximately 150.\n\n;I-MOD : The \"Infinity Modulator\" is a weapon designed by Tuvok, which changes modulation every time its fired so the Borg can't adapt to it. It is slightly less effective on Harvesters.\n::''In the videogame, they contain Borg technology, and were developed by Seven of Nine instead of Tuvok.''\n\n;Transporter tags : Miniature [[combadge]] shaped devices that could be slapped on a piece of equipment, and instantly be [[transporter|transported]] back to ''Voyager''.

Shortly after this, while they were exploring a nearby village, the tean was attacked by the [[Wraith]]. It was only thanks to the intervention of the Halcyons that they managed to survive the attack and so, after the Wraith were either killed or captured by the Halcyons, the tean met with them to see if the two groups could work together.

Their vision for New Reno's future is the same as its present, but more so: an expansion of the [[Jet (Fallout: New Vegas)|Jet]] trade, spreading the [[addiction]] all across the [[wastes]], with the Mordinos rising to prominence as the mightiest of the families without ever formalizing their rule or using violence to conquer other areas.\n\nIronically, Big Jesus Mordino has a vulnerable heart, which means that he cannot partake in the using of jet which his own family developed without suffering serious drawbacks. [[Lil' Jesus Mordino]] is the son of Big Jesus Mordino: he is a jet dealer and expert knife fighter. The Mordinos employ the irritating boy-genius [[Myron]] in the [[Stables]]. As the developers of jet, they continually attempt to refine their product, testing it on hapless [[Slavery|slave]]s. They also have the Corsican brothers of the [[Golden Globes]] under their tributary protection.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Mordinos appear only in ''[[Fallout 2]]''.

The game was released during the course of 2009 on the PC and Xbox 360.\n\nThe game features [[Wallace]] and his faithful canine companion, [[Gromit]] in a series of completely new, interactive adventures and storylines. In \"Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures\", players will play as both Wallace and Gromit as the duo embarks on a series of ambitious business ventures, and then scramble to pick up the scattered pieces when plans go awry.\n\n==Episode list==\n===Episode 1: Fright of the Bumblebees===\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;\">Wallace has opened a new business, \"From Bee to You\" specializing in delivering freshly made honey to his customers. He takes up the offer to provide fifty gallons of honey in repayment to the local grocer after his electric cheese-detecting machine accidentally rampaged through the store on a test run. However, Wallace has used up all the flowers in his garden, and is forced to improvise a growth formula to turn some daisy seeds provided by his neighbour, Ms. Flitt into giant flowers. The formula is a success, and he meets his client's demand but things soon go wrong when the bees react to the growth formula, becoming huge and terrorizing the town and Wallace's home. Gromit is able to trap most of the bees, but Wallace is stolen away by the giant queen bee. Gromit gives chase in Wallace's honey tanker truck, and is able to rescue Wallace. The two work together to feed the queen more honey dosed with more of the growth formula, forcing the bee to become stuck in a tunnel. Wallace works out an antidote to the growth formula to restore the bees to normal, though he accidentally shrinks himself in the process.</p>\n\n===Episode 2: The Last Resort===\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;\">Using their profits from the honey business, Wallace prepares to take Gromit to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool Blackpool], but the weather both spoils their plans and creates a small flood in the cellar. Wallace comes up with the idea of converting the water-logged cellar into an indoor holiday resort for the rest of the townsfolk, and seeks to keep them all happy, though Ms. Flitt's two puppies raise much havoc. When Ms. Flitt's boyfriend, Duncan McBiscuit is mysteriously injured, Wallace and Gromit deduce that the puppies, upset at having their chew toy taken away from them, attacked Duncan. In the episode's finale, the cellar drain becomes dislodged, and the puppies, chasing after their chew toy, follow it and end up in a prison cell, while Wallace starts to clean up the mess.</p>\n\n===Episode 3: Muzzled!===\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;\">Shortly after the holiday season, a charity fair comes into town, run by Monty Muzzle, to raise money for a new dog shelter. After dealing with three strays in their home, Wallace and Gromit go to the fair with Wallace's new invention to create any flavour of ice cream. At the fair, Gromit discovers that Mr. Muzzle is actually attempting to steal away the townspeople's donations and using the strays as manual labor for the fair. When Wallace and Gromit uncover Mr. Muzzle's intentions, he escapes on a makeshift balloon, but Wallace and Gromit give chase, denying Mr. Muzzle of his ill-gotten money while saving all the strays. Ms. Flitt, who dumped Duncan McBiscuit earlier in the episode and has grown to admire the \"bravery\" of Wallace (unaware that it was actually Gromit that stopped Muzzle), mistakes his confusion at finding a loose [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(hardware) fastening nut] as an engagement ring and a marriage proposal from him.</p>\n\n===Episode 4: The Bogey Man===\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;\">In order to defuse Ms. Flitt's mistake, Gromit manages to make Wallace a member of the local [[Wikipedia:Country club|country club]], Prickly Thicket, which Ms. Flitt's aunt loathes and soundly rejects her niece's marriage to Wallace. The local constable, jealous that Wallace was admitted over him, uses an obscure [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bylaw bylaw] to threaten the club with closure since it does not have a golf course–or rather it does, but members do not know where it is because the deed is missing, safely held in a security system designed by Wallace's (apparent) ancestor, Goodman Witless (and his faithful dog Gimlet). Using his detective equipment Wallace manages to find the deed, but discovers that the entire town was built on the golf course, and a vengeful Duncan decides to have the town destroyed in order to rebuild the course. Wallace challenges Duncan to a golf tourney so that he may become chairman and tear up the deed, saving the town, and manages to win with Gromit's help. However, as he goes to tear the deed, the security system traps him and the other townsfolk in a room, and Gromit is forced to disable the trap and free everyone. Wallace tears up the deed, and is thankful to find that Ms. Flitt has cancelled their engagement and gone back to Duncan, who her aunt now approves of since he is no longer the club chairman.</p>\n\n==Cast==\n*Ben Whitehead - Wallace\n*[[Wikipedia:Struan Rodger|Struan Rodger]] - Monty Muzzle\n*Heather Coombs - Felicity Flitt\n*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Marinker Peter Marinker] - Mr. Paneer\n*Dean Willamson - P.

The entire film (apart from external shots) was filmed in one building over the span of 25 days. It was released in most parts of the world on October 28, 2005, but not released in Australia until December 1, 2005. [[wikipedia:Darren Lynn Bousman|Darren Lynn Bousman]] took over directing duties, and also co-wrote the story's script with [[wikipedia:Leigh Whannell|Leigh Whannell]], the original film's co-writer.\n\nThe film features the antagonist of the previous film, the [[John Kramer|Jigsaw Killer]], finally being apprehended, but trapping the arresting officer in one of his own games while showing another \"game\" of eight people in progress at the same time. It also explored the character's back story, explaining why he became a serial killer.\n\nThe film is currently #16 on Bravo's Even Scarier Movie Moments. Following the film's opening weekend gross of $31.5m, [[wikipedia:Lions Gate Films|Lions Gate Films]] commissioned ''[[Saw III]]'', released on October 27, 2006.\n\n'''Taglines:'''\n*''Oh yes... There will be blood''\n*''New game. Different pieces''\n*''We dare you again''\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in a darkened room where [[Michael Marks]], a police informant, awakens in a chair, wearing [http://sawfilms.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_traps_in_the_Saw_film_series#The_Cock_Mask an iron mask-like device around his neck]. He learns that he is in a trap constructed by the [[Jigsaw Killer]] and is being punished for being \"a snitch\". In order to stop the device from springing and driving nails into his head, Michael must cut out his eye with a scalpel and retrieve the key from the inside of his eye socket within sixty seconds. However, he is unable to do so, and is killed.\n\nThe scene cuts to [[Detective Eric Matthews]] releasing his son [[Daniel Matthews|Daniel]] from police custody after getting in trouble. After arguing with his son, Matthews is called in to investigate Michael's death. At the crime scene, the police discover a message in the room that says LOOK CLOSER DETECTIVE MATTHEWS. Realizing that the mask bore a Wilson Steel logo, Matthews gathers a SWAT team and arrives at the company's abandoned factory, which has now become Jigsaw's headquarters. However, the building is booby-trapped, and several officers are injured before the others discover [[John Kramer|Jigsaw]] upstairs, considerably weakened from the effects of cancer. Before Jigsaw is taken into custody, he reveals a set of television monitors, showing several people trapped in a [[Nerve Gas House|mysterious house]], with Daniel being among them. There is also a timer counting down, with less than two hours left.\n\nIn the room, the trapped individuals begin to awaken and one of them is revealed to be [[Amanda Young]], the only known survivor of Jigsaw's traps. Amanda finds a tape recorder in the room which tells them that a toxic nerve gas is leaking into the house and they only have a limited time to find antidotes for themselves, one of which is in a safe in the room, the combination to which they are unaware. The action in ''Saw II'' now switches between the captives in the house and the team trying to save them in Jigsaw’s office.\n\nInside the house, a note tells to not use the key to unlock the door to the room, they are currently locked in. Ignoring the note's warning, embezzler [[Gus Colyard|Gus]] is quickly killed by a magnum revolver which is set off by turning the key in the lock while peering out the [[List of traps in the Saw film series#Magnum eyehole|door's eyehole]]. The door opens by itself eventually and the others carefully proceed and find the door that leads to the basement of the house. Once there, they find a message for [[Obi Tate|Obi]], an arsonist, revealing that he helped in the capture of everybody in the house. They then discover a [[List of traps in the Saw film series#Furnace|furnace]] holding two antidotes in syringes. One antidote is for Obi while the other is for another of his choice. Obi tries to retrieve the syringes, but the door to the furnace locks and flames burst. Obi is told to twist the knob to stop the fire, but is unable to do so and burns alive in the furnace.\n\nIn the headquarters, Jigsaw informs Matthews that, in order to save his son's life, he must talk with him long enough; Matthews agrees as the other officers try to trace the video signal being fed to the monitors. Jigsaw explains that he decided to become the Jigsaw Killer after being diagnosed with terminal cancer and a failed suicide attempt, in order to teach the others the value of life. He also explains that his \"signature\", a stamp of a jigsaw puzzle piece left on the victim, is symbolic of that person missing a crucial part of themselves; the survival instinct.\n\nIn the house, another tape is found, in which Jigsaw condemns [[Xavier Chavez|Xavier]] for being a drug dealer; [[Needle Pit|a large pit full of hypodermic needles]] is then found, with a key hidden somewhere inside. Xavier throws Amanda into the needle pit instead of going into it himself. Amanda retrieves the key, but Xavier fails to gain access to the antidote in time, resulting in him splitting up from the others.\n\nMatthews is frustrated with Jigsaw's philosophical ramblings, and Jigsaw reveals that the people trapped in the house are all criminals who were framed by Matthews at one point, and that his son will most likely be killed should the others discover this. As a tech team arrives to trace the signal, Matthews is advised to destroy Jigsaw's trap plans. He does so, but Jigsaw remains calm and refuses to talk. Meanwhile, Xavier searches for a way to escape by going back to the room the where everyone woke up, eventually finding a colored number written on the back of Gus' neck. Realizing this is the part of the combination to the safe, Xavier is then confronted by [[Jonas Singer|Jonas]]. Xavier kills Jonas and retrieves his number and begins stalking the others, who now know Daniel is Matthews' son. [[Addison Corday|Addison]] abandons the group and [[Laura Hunter|Laura]] succumbs to the nerve gas.\n\nAddison stumbles upon [[Razor Box Trap|a glass box containing an antidote]], but falls victim to the device, revealed to be one of Jigsaw's traps. Xavier comes to Addison, but to only obtain her number, leaving Addison to scream in anguish as she bleeds to death. Xavier then discovers that Daniel is Matthews' son and hunts him and Amanda down. Watching this, Matthews loses control and violently assaults Jigsaw, nearly killing him and ultimately forcing him at gunpoint to take him to the house, unbeknownst to the other detectives. As they depart, the tech team discovers the signal and follows it. Xavier discovers other numbers and then follows Amanda and Daniel through a trapdoor, which leads to [[The Bathroom Trap]] from the [[Saw|first film]], featuring Zep's tape recorder, the severed foot of [[Dr. Lawrence Gordon]] and the remains of [[Zep Hindle]] and [[Adam Faulkner]] in an advanced state of decomposition, revealing that Dr. Gordon, from the first film, did not succeed in finding help, as he promised, and that Adam did not survive the bathroom trap. Daniel and Amanda stare in terror at the gore and decaying matter around them. Screams and dialogue from the victims (Adam, Dr. Gordon and Zep) of the previous film are replayed, as well as Jigsaw's voice. Xavier arrives and threatens Amanda for her number, in which she tells him that he still does not know his own number and asks how will he get it if she doesn't tell him. Xavier has no choice, but to slice off the skin from the back of his neck to retrieve his number. Daniel pretends to pass out, but when Xavier tries to attack him, Daniel surprises him and slashes his throat with a nearby hacksaw (the same one Dr. Gordon used to saw his foot off in the previous film).\n\nMeanwhile, Matthews arrives at the house, and makes his way inside, eventually finding the trapdoor. The SWAT team, meanwhile, arrives at the location of the video signal; they realize that the monitors were actually showing a tape recording; the events in the house took place before the factory raid, and that the SWAT team is in the wrong house. Meanwhile, in the correct house, Matthews arrives in the bathroom and is injected in the thigh and knocked unconscious by a person wearing Jigsaw's pig mask. Back at Jigsaw's headquarters, the timer expires and a safe opens, revealing a barely-conscious Daniel.\n\nIn the bathroom, Matthews awakens to find an audio tape lying next to him. The tape reveals that Amanda, now Jigsaw's protégé, has put him there. In a series of flashbacks, we learn that Amanda will now continue Jigsaw's work after his death, and that her first trap will involve Matthews. Matthews then sees that he has been shackled to a pipe, and is hopeless, like Adam from the first film. Amanda then appears outside the bathroom, and closes the bathroom door as Matthews screams at her in fury, leaving him to die like Adam at the end of the first film. Meanwhile, a barely-alive Jigsaw waits in the van outside. Slowly, Jigsaw forms a smile as Matthews screams in the bathroom.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS CAST, THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE CREDITS IN THE MOVIE-->\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"300\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[John Kramer|''Jigsaw/John'']]\n|'''Tobin Bell'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Amanda Young|''Amanda'']]\n|'''Shawnee Smith'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Eric Matthews|''Eric Matthews'']]\n|'''Donnie Wahlberg'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Daniel Matthews|''Daniel Matthews'']]\n|'''Erik Knudsen'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Xavier Chavez|''Xavier'']]\n|'''Franky G'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Jonas Singer|''Jonas'']]\n|'''Glenn Plummer'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Addison Corday|''Addison'']]\n|'''Emmanuelle Vaugier'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Laura Hunter|''Laura'']]\n|'''Beverley Mitchell'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Obi Tate|''Obi'']]\n|'''Timothy Burd'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Allison Kerry|''Kerry'']]\n|'''Dina Meyer'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Daniel Rigg|''Rigg'']]\n|'''Lyriq Bent'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Michael Marks|''Michael'']]\n|'''Noam Jenkins'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|[[Gus Colyard|''Gus'']]\n|'''Tony Nappo'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''SWAT Member Pete''\n|'''Kelly Jones'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''SWAT Member Joe''\n|'''Vincent Rother'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''Mother In Cancer Ward''\n|'''Linette Robinson'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''Nurse In Cancer Ward''\n|'''Gretchen Helbig'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''Boy In Cancer Ward''\n|'''Kofi Payton'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''Video Techie''\n|'''John Fallon'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''Security Officer''\n|'''Ho \"Oyster\" Chow'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|''Additional Voice Talents''\n|'''Conrad Coates'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|\n|'''James Gallanders'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|\n|'''Sam Malkin'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right; \"|\n|'''Robin Ward'''\n|}\n\n==Critical Reaction==\nReviews on Saw II were generally negative.Many critics who liked the first film hated the second film.Peter Travers,Film critic of Rolling Stone and Editor,gave Saw II a negative review despite liking the first installment.Stating that ''Saw II does have a lot more traps than the original but throughout the film,there's nothing but stupid plot-points and new characters that fall flat though I did like only two new characters in Saw II and those are Daniel Matthews and Alison Kerry.I like the characters because they have strong acting and well done performances''. Travers gave the film one out of four stars but however did well recieve Erik Knudson and Dina Meyer's roles.Positive reviews came from people such as Grae Drake,the editor for Rotten Tomatoes,who did enjoy Saw II.Stating that ''A lot of people say that Saw is a fantastic horror film and I agree with them.Then came Saw II and after I came out of the theater after seeing the film and I was blown away,actually.I think the best scene in the second film is the ending where the character of Amanda Young ceils Eric Matthews in the bathroom from the first film and leaves him to die just like what John Kramer ceils Adam in the bathroom in the previous one.'' Due to the negative reception of Saw II,Rotten Tomatoes gave the film 35 out of 100,much to Grae's dismay.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Saw II (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Uncut Edition==\n''Saw II'' has been released on a standard as well as a \"Special Edition\" uncut DVD. Differences in this edition include:\n\n*When the police are entering Wilson Steel, three short cuts are shown of Jigsaw eating Cheerios upstairs and realizing the police have arrived. When he realizes this, he calmly goes back to what he was working on.\n*Jigsaw has a few extra lines of dialogue with Detective Matthews, mentioning that he has \"wiped the slate clean\", and that most people are merely \"sleepwalking\".\n*When Obi is trapped in the oven, he attempts to break the glass on the far side as he is burning alive.\n*The scene of Amanda thrashing around in the [[List of traps in the Saw film series#Saw II Traps|syringe pit]] is extended.\n*In the bathroom, Charlie Clouser's score begins as Xavier begins cutting off his skin, and continues until he dies from his throat being slashed.\n*The opening scene with \"The Venus Headtrap\" is extended and the song \"Irresponsible Hate Anthem (Venus Headtrap Mix)\" is playing in the background.\n*The scene where Matthews is beating up Jigsaw is extended with one extra punch.\n\nThis is the shortest unrated version in the series at 93 minutes, whereas ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Saw III]]'''s unrated versions are close to two hours.\n\n==Box office gross==\n\n*Made for only $4 million, ''Saw II'' grossed over $144 million worldwide, which includes $87 million in the United States.\n\n==Poster==\n\n\n<gallery position=\"center\" orientation=\"none\" widths=\"250\" captionalign=\"left\">\nSawIIposter2.jpg|'''Promotional poster'''\nsaw-2-poster.jpg|'''Banned Promotional poster'''\nB000CRR324.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg|'''DVD Full Screen Edition'''\nsaw2uncutbig.jpg|'''DVD 2-Disc Uncut Edition'''\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n*One of the posters for the film ''[[wikipedia:Scary Movie 4|Scary Movie 4]]'' parodied the \"severed fingers\" poster for this film. But instead of a two, three fingers form the number four, and one has a Hello Kitty bandage. The tagline is \"The funniest thing you ever sawed.\"\n*When Jigsaw tells Kerry over the walkie-talkie the location of the file containing information everyone in the house, he says \"Brown desk, second drawer\". The desk the file is found in, however, is white.\n*The code/combination for the safe is (Red) 2, (Orange) ?, (Yellow) 16, (Green) 11, (Blue) 9, (Indigo) 25, (Violet) 8.\n*In the Uncut Edition, as with the first Saw, there is an easter egg called \"Saw 2 in 62\". It has three \"takes\", the first one is using clay figures modeled after the characters in the film, the second replaces the character with common materials, and the third one uses photos from the film which are animated.\n*Contains several references to the 1972 film ''The Last House on the Left''. Most obvious when John tells Eric that his son is in \"the last house on the left\".\n*When Kerry and Eric are talking at the station, [[Darren Lynn Bousman]] is seen (with an afro) on a wanted poster. He also wore a robe to act out the part of Jigsaw for Michael's tape at the beginning of the film.\n*The house number 237 is also the same number of the room in ''The Shining''.\n*In the scene where Kerry tells Matthews to threaten Jigsaw that he'll destroy his work, you can clearly see a drawing of the Razor Box Trap, soon following in the film.\n*During the raid of Jigsaw's hideout in the opening of the film, when cars/armored vehicles drive by the camera, you can faintly see for a short time shadows of people (possibly the crew behind the camera or extras standing off screen).\n*The amount of nerve antidotes was not enough to cover all eight people in the nerve gas house (one from the safe, two from the furnace, one from the [[Needle Pit]], and one from the [[Razor Box Trap]]). Since Amanda and Daniel were meant to survive, they were most likely given their antidotes in advance. However, there was arguably a high chance that there was enough antidote for everyone in the safe as they all could work together and not leave the first room. However there were possobly more trials in the house that were not seen.\n*It took 120,000 syringes to complete the needle pit sequence. It took four days for four people to replace the needle tips with fiber tips.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n*[http://www.saw2.com/ Official website]\n*[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/ IMDb]\n*[http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?name=movies&id=1543956/ ''Saw III'': Jigsaw Cuts Loose ]Video interview with [[Tobin Bell]] on [http://www.mtv.com/ MTV.com]\n*[http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20051028_exclusive_interview_donnie_wah.html Donnie Wahlberg interview for Saw II]\n[[Category:Films]]",

Roger quarrels with Sam and with Joe.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n:''My name is [[Victoria Winters]]. In [[Collinwood]], this great and gloomy house perched on [[Widows' Hill]], life goes on as usual. And so does death, with the doubts and fears that accompany it, especially when it is a death that has not been fully explained.''\n\n[[Sam Evans|Sam]] calls [[Roger Collins|Roger]] and they plan a meeting at [[The Blue Whale]]. [[Victoria Winters|Vicki]] meets Roger on the way out and she lets it slip that she's been to the Blue Whale--with [[Burke Devlin|Burke]]. She relays the reason, see ([[30]]-[[34]]). At the Blue Whale, Sam enjoys drinking for the first time (yeah, right) since Burke's return. [[Joe Haskell|Joe]] shows up looking blue, and Maggie asks Sam to ask him to join them. The trio have a very funny conversation about the '[[Collins]] Family of [[Collinsport]]' after Joe tells them he was stood up by Carolyn. They start a drinking game, during which Joe says he's 'about 86th in line' for [[Bill Malloy|Malloy]]'s job and blames himself for being stood up (because he wouldn't play hooky and go to the beach with Carolyn, see [[69]]). When Joe excuses himself, Maggie shines and Sam calls her out--he doesn't want to see her get hurt. Joe calls Collinwood and gets Vicki, who tells him that Carolyn went out for a drive. Joe asks Maggie (not Sam) to dance.\n\nVicki and Roger are heading to the Blue Whale after they talk about being 'just a' whatever (he is still being very complimentary to her). Maggie and Joe talk about the Old Days. Roger and Vicki enter and the trio remarks on their closeness. Sam 'just happens' to have something to talk to Roger about, so he joins the duo. Vicki joins Maggie and Joe. Roger and Sam admit they don't think the other killed Malloy anymore. Roger is worried that if Malloy could get something out of Sam, Burke easily could. Sam promises it won't happen. Roger asks about the letter. Maggie and Joe inquire about the hiring of a housekeeper. Maggie reiterates that she's creeped out by [[Sarah Johnson]]. Vicki likens Carolyn and Liz to each other due to their mood swings. Vicki admits that she and Carolyn have fought about Burke, whom Maggie posits likes Vicki better. Joe thinks it's old ground and Maggie calls him a dope.\n\nRoger reminds Sam of the letter's contents and Sam reminds him that it will only be seen if something happens to him. He posits that Malloy might have been smart to have written a letter of his own. They accuse each other of being involved in the death of Bill Malloy. Roger rejoins Vicki, Maggie, and Joe and tells Vicki it's time to go home because he has a headache. He then insults them by assuming they were speaking of the price of \"fish and hash.\" He then blames his headache. Joe says that doesn't give him the right to speak that way to Maggie, and Roger accuses him of forgetting his place. Joe continues to stand up for Maggie and Roger continues to be insulting. After Roger leaves, Joe makes threats. Maggie lightens the mood.\n\nRoger's headache mysteriously is cured. He offers Vicki a nightcap and asks for a second time around. Vicki says it will be possible when the housekeeper is hired. Roger's shocked about the decision and even more so when he learns Mrs. Johnson is the intended one.\n\n== Memorable quotes ==\n\n== Dramatis personae ==\n\n* [[76|←]] [[Louis Edmonds]] as [[Roger Collins]] [[80|→]]\n* [[73|←]] [[David Ford]] as [[Sam Evans]] [[79|→]]\n* [[73|←]] [[Kathryn Leigh Scott]] as [[Maggie Evans]] [[79|→]]\n* [[69|←]] [[Joel Crothers]] as [[Joe Haskell]] [[80|→]]\n* [[76|←]] and [[Alexandra Moltke]] as [[Victoria Winters]] [[80|→]]\n\n== Background information and notes ==\n\n*The first time a romance is hinted at between Maggie and Joe.\n*Location shot: Blue Whale from outside, water churning, boats docked.\n\n== Bloopers and continuity errors ==\n\n*Roger talks during the narration as he's on the phone and we do not hear him.\n*Roger seems to flub to Sam.

The campaign was set in the [[Cularin system]], created especially for the campaign and detailed in the ''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''. The campaign was initially set one year after ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'',<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20021027114049/www.wizards.com/rpga/livingforce/article.asp?x=lf/swlf_characterguide&c=swlfc Living Force Character Guidelines]</ref> but to keep current with the movies, the Cularin system time jumped almost ten years when ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' came out.\n\nThe ''Living Force'' campaign lasted for six years, coming to a conclusion after ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' was released. The adventures of the campaign were distributed by the RPGA through its membership for conventions and game days. They were supplemented by articles providing stories, information about the Cularin system, and rules updates for the campaign on the [[Wizards of the Coast]] website.\n\nThe main story arc of the campaign was titled ''Among the Stars''.  A side story arc called ''Law and Order'' was being created by campaign staff in Great Britain, but was canceled after only four adventures were released.\n\n==Characters==\n===Mother Dariana===\n{{Main|Dariana}}\nDariana was the [[Mother (title)|Mother]] of the [[Tarasin]] [[Hiironi irstat]], the largest irstat on Cularin. In this role, she was an influential figure among the native Tarasin, able to convene a council of elders with decision making power for all Tarasin. On numerous occasions, Dariana recorded her memoirs, sharing insights on the events occurring in the Cularin system.\n\n===Yara Grugara===\n{{Main|Yara Grugara}}\nYara Grugara was a reporter for [[Cularin Central Broadcasting]], originally on the talk show \"[[Eye on Cularin]].\" She became a key commentator on events in the system, obtaining interviews with many of the key personalities in the system, such as the crime lord Nirama and the Jedi Masters Qel-Bertuk and Kirlocca. Grugara later endorsed the efforts of the Cualrin Militia, drawing criticism from some areas. While many thought her vapid, her persistence in interviews often produced surprising results.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Kirlocca===\n[[File:Kirlocca headshot.JPG|left|120px]]\n{{Main|Kirlocca}}\nKirlocca was a [[Jedi Master]] at the time of the [[Invasion of Naboo]]. A [[Wookiee]] [[sexes|male]], he was the [[lightsaber]] [[Jedi instructor|instructor]] at the [[Almas Academy]]. Kirlocca was kind-hearted and wise, but felt the best way to impart what he knew was through martial training, helping the younger to direct their energies through fencing. In addition to lightsaber instruction, some of Kirlocca's other duties including helping with basic Force exercises and overseeing aspects of the Jedi Trials. Kirlocca was attending a peace conference with a number of other Jedi when Raik Muun attempted to use two [[T'salak]]s to turn the Jedi mediators into crazed killers, so as to discredit the Order. Her plan failed, but Master Kirlocca was killed by the t'salaks and Raik managed to escape.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Thurm Loogg===\n{{Main|Thurm Loogg}}\nThurm Loogg was the Metatheran Cartel's envoy to the Cularin system after Velin Wir. He headed the Cartel's offices on Cularin and oversaw their mining operations on Tilnes, but was more of a spokesman and facilitator than a true executive.\n\n===Nirama===\n[[File:Nirama Headshot.PNG|left|120px]]\n{{Main|Nirama}}\nNirama was an [[Oblee]] [[crime lord]] who controlled all crime in the [[Cularin system]]. He was formerly an accountant for [[Riboga]] the [[Hutt]], but managed to take over his whole [[Organization]]. He was based in the [[Cularin system asteroid belt]] and developed a great love for the Cularin system. His organization fought on the side of the [[Cularin Militia]] against the [[Navy of Thaere]].<ref name=\"LFC\">''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lanius Qel-Bertuk===\n[[File:LaniusQel-Bertuk.jpg|left|120px]]\n{{Main|Lanius Qel-Bertuk}}\nLanius Qel-Bertuk was a renowned [[Jedi Master]] and Headmaster at the [[Almas Academy|Jedi Academy]] on [[Almas]]. Lanius Qel-Bertuk was considered by some to be one of the wisest [[Jedi]] in the [[Jedi Order|Order]]. Qel-Bertuk was a Human male with ice-blue eyes, raven-black hair and a greying beard in a friendly, commonly-smiling face. He had a burn scar on his left cheek and was missing the third finger on his left hand.<ref name=\"LFC\" />\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Jir Tramsig===\n{{Main|Jir Tramsig}}\nJir Tramsig was the leader of the [[Navy of Thaere]] in the Cularin system. A ruthless and ambitious man, he had a reputation for caring more for the successful completion of a mission than the welfare of his subordinates. He eventually led his forces against the Cularin Militia, seeking to control the system through force, a development prompted by the Navy's affiliation with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Lavina Wren===\n{{Main|Lavina Durada-Vashne Wren}}\nLavina Durada-Vashne Wren was a female Human Senator of the Galactic Republic who represented the Cularin system from 32 BBY to 19 BBY. She constantly campaigned for Cularin during her terms on Coruscant, including during the ten year absence of the Cularin system from the galaxy. She endorsed the efforts of the Cularin Militia fighting against the Navy of Thaere and pressed their cause in the Senate, drawing assassination attempts. When it became clear the direction the Republic was taking, Wren withdrew Cularin from the Republic, declaring it a sovereign independent system.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Media==\n===Adventures===\nThe Living Force campaign was composed of a number of story arcs, each lasting one year although with some story elements that continued throughout the campaign. Each year contained four adventure trilogies, of which three contributed to the central story line, with one additional trilogy on more peripheral events. These were trilogies were supplemented with between one and three stand-alone adventures. These adventures were all released first at conventions, but then became available for play at home at a later date.<ref name=\"Living Force website\">{{Wizards|url=default.asp?x=starwars/livingforce/swlf20010906whatislf|text=What's the Living Force?}}</ref>\n\nMost Living Force adventures were designed to be played in the four-hour time slots used at gaming conventions. ''[[A Mon Alone]]'' was an extra long adventure to be run in two time slots. The adventures were meant for 4-6 players (though for a short time, the RPGA allowed 3-7), and GMs were expected to run the adventures as written and without using house rules, so that all players had a similar play experience. Living Force adventures were usually retired about one and a half to two years after they premiered. Games played within 30 days of the premiere submitted an events summary to the campaign staff, with the results of the majority of the tables determining the results for the campaign (i.e. if a villain escaped for over half the tables submitting events summaries, that villain did escape and could recur later).\n\nAnother type of adventure was called an interactive, which had all the available players playing together in a mostly live action roleplaying ([[Wikipedia:LARP|LARP]]) situation. The players mostly interacted with each other and NPCs in a social setting. There were often activities that could be engaged in, such as [[podracing]], [[gambling]], marksmanship contests, or [[starship]] combat sims. Players could submit orders to metaorganizations, such as [[Joh's New and Used Droid Emporium]] and the [[Ma'Haffee Shipyard]]. Some interactives featured periods where the players would break up into groups of 4-6 and sit down for a short segment of tabletop roleplaying. Many interactives only ran once, with the results of that event being the results for the campaign, though a few were made available for later conventions.\n\n{|{{Prettytable}}\n!colspan=\"3\"|Key:\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFBB60;\" width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"|Adventure trilogies\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF80;\" width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"|Associated interactives\n|style=\"background-color:#40CC40;\" width=\"33%\" align=\"center\"|Stand-alone adventures\n|}\n\n{|{{Prettytable}}\n!

Once the campaign got underway, these typically came out once a week, most written by plot director Morrie Mullins. Many were written as supplements to specific adventures, while others detailed other events in the Cularin system, often in the format of an in-universe component followed by some out-of-universe context and/or roleplaying statistics. [[JD Wiker]] also wrote some articles more specifically related to roleplaying issues, such as how to properly portray a Jedi or how to create an ongoing campaign villain.\n\n'''Living Force articles

in the movies. It began with the events of ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'', and integrated various references to the events contained within. For instance, one of the early antagonists was the [[Metatheran Cartel]], a splinter corporation that broke away from the [[Trade Federation]]. However, all the early adventures were required to occur within the [[Cularin system]], and writers were not allowed to ulitize any plot elements or technologies from the movies.<ref>''[[Writers Guidelines]]''</ref> In order to keep pace with the movies, a plot device was included to move that action forward ten years to the setting of ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]''; achieved by removing the whole [[Cularin system]] from [[the galaxy]] through the use of a [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] artifact, and returning it to [[the galaxy]] at a later date.\n\nOne of the first external references to the Living Force campaign came in [[Abel G. Peña]]'s ''[[Droids, Technology and the Force: A Clash of Phenomena]]'' published in March [[2005]], which involved Uffel in the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. Later in [[2006]] and [[2007]], [[Karen Traviss]] mentioned Cularin in both ''[[Republic Commando: Triple Zero]]'' and ''[[Republic Commando: True Colors]]''; the Cularin system was described as Separatist-friendly which did not fully mesh with the campaign itself. The Cularin system was also the setting for ''[[Echoes of the Jedi]]'', an adventure written by Peña and [[Jean-François Boivin]] for the [[Dawn of Defiance]] campaign. This adventure utilized many features from across the Living Force campaign.\n\nWizards of the Coast also included the [[Tarasin]], [[Caarite]], and [[Filordus]] in their ''[[Ultimate Alien Anthology]]''. Later, ''[[Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force]]'' also made numerous references to the Jedi of the Cularin system, even directly quoting a speech given by [[Lanius Qel-Bertuk]] from ''[[Friendship in the Order]]''. In [[2008]], [[Nirama]] and the [[Metatheran Cartel]] were referenced in ''[[Millennium Falcon (novel)|Millennium Falcon]]'', then a number of the characters and locations also received entries in ''[[The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''. Later, the ''[[Rebellion Era Campaign Guide]]'' included an adventure hook set in the Cularin system. Many of the worlds mentioned in passing in the campaign were included in the Appendix of ''[[The Essential Atlas]]''.\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Living Force Campaign Guide]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wizards|url=default.asp?x=starwars/swlfwelcome|text=Living Force}}\n\n{{Interlang\n|pt=Living Force (RPG)\n|ru=Living Force (RPG)\n}}\n\n[[Category:Living Force adventures| ]]\n[[Category:Living Force articles| ]]",

    "wikiText": "[[File:Twelve_Tales.jpg|thumb|The logo for the infamous Twelve Tales.]]\n'''''Twelve Tales: Conker 64''''' (known in the PAL regions as '''''Twelve Tales Conker''''') is a cancelled video game sequel to ''[[Conker's Pocket Tales]]'' that was going to be released for the [[Nintendo 64]], but got changed to ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' due to the fact that people called it a ''cutesy'' game, making [[Rare]] overreact. Then, the series was changed into a rated M series and featured Conker having a complete different personality.\n\nAround the time of its announcement, Rare had already made two similar games, ''Banjo-Kazooie'' and ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]''. They began to receive criticism for making another innocent platformer starring cute animals. So, in 1999, Rare Ltd. revealed that they were going to redesign the game to appeal to an older audience.\n\nMany people thought it was a bad April Fool's Joke, and didn't take it seriously, but sure enough, the game was released in 2001 as ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'', a lewd, mature game that starred an alcoholic, foul-mouthed squirrel. It's unknown if the original version will ever see the light of day. Some things were kept from the original version such as the flowers in the [[Hungover]] chapter, [[Birdy|the scarecrow]], and the Windmill.   Also, the music for a Roman-themed world was used as the theme song for Jet Force Gemini.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the game you're working to recollect more than 100 presents stolen by the evil \"hoodlums\" and scattered throughout four worlds. While questing through the worlds collecting presents you must save your friends who were kidnapped and free the universe of the hoodlums.\n\nConker and [[Berri]] will swing from branch to branch in Cuckoo Village, dodge falling boulders in the Popcorn Mines, travel through time in Wind Mill Pasture and slide through twisting lava tubes in an active volcano. Of course they'll have help in the form of a wise mentor, Knowit the Owl, and will also obtain exotic tools and equipment, like unicycles, umbrellas and a nut-hurling catapult. The game will also consist of time travelling.\n\nOne feature of the game that looks really good is how you can play the game with two player or in a four person battle.\n\n==Pictures==\n<gallery>\nFile:TTC-US.jpg\nFile:TTC-US2.jpg\nFile:TTC-EU.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Videos==\nOn September 17, 2012 a 30 minute gameplay video was uploaded to Youtube by IOnElFalcon.\n\n[[File:30 Minutes of Twelve Tales Conker 64 Gameplay|thumb|right|400px]]\n\n[[Video:Conker's Twelve Tales Beta Gameplay BFD Prototype|thumb|400px|right]]\n[[Video:Conker Twelve Tales - Beta Movie|thumb|400px|right]]\n[[Category:Games]]\n[[Category:Twelve Tales: Conker 64]]",

    "wikiText": "{{cleanup|there are several editorial opinions which may or may not be appropriate. See the [[Talk:Ultima IV|talk page]]}}\n[[Image:U4box.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Game Box Art]]\n[[Image:U4title.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Title Screen (PC-EGA)]]\n[[Image:U4vga.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Wilderness (PC-VGA)]]\n\n'''Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar''' is the fourth game in the series and the first installment of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" trilogy. It was published and released in 1985 by Origin for the Apple II, C64, IBM-PC and Atari 8-bit. Ports for the Amiga and Atari ST with some enhanced graphics followed 1988, for the NES and Sega Master System ports were released in 1990. In 2013, the game was made available on the iOS.<ref>[http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/09/07/download-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-on-ios-for-free Download Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar on iOS for Free]</ref> \n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nThe game became much more complex and deep with this installment, compared to ''[[Ultima III]]''. The people of [[Britannia]] can talk interactively. The puzzles are more complex, and more information has to be gathered to solve the game. Cities, castles and dungeons are much more detailed, as is the wilderness. The number of items to be found has risen, and the total party size is expanded to eight.\n\nThe most significant improvement for the game's [[Richard Garriott|creator]] is the plot, where the player has to follow a path of [[Eight Virtues|Virtue]] to win. The killing and thievery of the three earlier games is now strongly discouraged. Instead, the player must prove to be a \"good guy.\" The whole system of virtues in this game changes the RPG experience.\n\n== The Story ==\n\n{{Spoiler}}\n\nWith the end of the [[Triad of Evil]] and, therefore the [[Age of Darkness|Ages of Darkness]], a new age has begun for [[Sosaria]], which now is Britannia&mdash;the \"Age of Enlightenment\". In the now united kingdom, the people search for spiritual enlightenment now that they are enjoying an age of prosperity.<ref name=\"prosperity\">''The History of Britannia'' (in-game). Page 20.</ref> However, there is one thing still missing: a role-model to be an example of the Eight Virtues. The people need this paragon of virtue called the [[Avatar]].\n\nThe player again plays the [[Stranger]], but this time the ultimate goal is not to defeat an evil villain&mdash;instead a path of Virtue has to be followed and a virtuous life led. Together with seven companions, the Stranger manages to master all of the eight Virtues by talking to the people, meditating at shrines and setting a good example by living the Virtues. Recovering a number of important artifacts, as well as the [[Key of Three Parts]], the party then descends into the depths of [[the Abyss]], where they ultimately recover the [[Codex of Ultimate Wisdom]]. The Codex asks a series of questions relating to the Virtues, after which it confirms the Stranger as the Avatar, the hero of Britannia and defender of Virtue.\n\n{{Endspoiler}}\n\n== Development ==\nPart of the reason for the change in direction in the series in this installment were letters from concerned parents and other parties, whom [[Richard Garriott]] felt misunderstood the games.<ref name=\"misunderstanding\">Addams, Shay. \"More than 'Just Beating Up Monsters'\". ''The Official Book of Ultima''. COMPUTE! Publications, Inc.: 1990. Page 35.</ref> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothered_About_Dungeons_and_Dragons Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons] was one such organization. This made Garriott consider the impact that the games have on the players, and therefore sought a more edifying theme;<ref name=\"100 hours\">Addams, Shay. \"The Turning Point\". ''The Official Book of Ultima''. COMPUTE! Publications, Inc.: 1990. Page 37-38.</ref> therefore, the Virtues.\n\n=== Differences between platforms ===\n\nThere are quite a number of ports of ''Ultima IV'' that are significantly different from each other. The original version was the one for the Apple II, from which all others were ported.\n\nThe 8-bit ports for the Apple II, C64 and Atari were similar in terms of graphics and music, and indeed shared much of the program code, as all these systems were based on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502 MOS 6502] CPU or derivatives thereof. The Atari 8-bit lacked music and had fewer colors, and on PAL Ataris it was black-and-white; the Apple II version offered more voices of music than the C64 version, but a sound card (Mockingboard or compatible) was required for music, as the Apple lacked an on-board sound chip. The C64 version had only black-and-white graphics in the 3D dungeon view.\n\nThe 16 bit-ports for the PC, Atari ST and Amiga were quite different. While the overworld graphics looked the same, the introduction sequence and dungeons looked better on the Amiga and Atari ST. Also, the PC lacked the mouse support and musical score of these ports. For more see [[Computer Ports of Ultima IV]].\n\nThe NES port has many of the same problems as the port of ''[[Ultima III]]'', although the graphics aren't as simplistic. The port for the Sega Master System, on the other hand, is surprisingly accurate and has good graphics and sound, with obvious limitations only on conversations. For both ports see [[Console Ports of Ultima IV]].\n\n=== Translations ===\n\n''Ultima IV'' had the dubious honor of being the first ''Ultima'' game translated into French, with both manuals and in-game text fully translated. While the translation for the manual was decent (albeit with some obvious mistakes), the in-game translation appears to have been done by people with no understanding of French.\n\nAn example of the mistakes in the translation is the translation of the traditional \"Board Frigate\" message seen when boarding a boat. It was translated as \"Tableau Frégate\", which translates \"Board\" as a noun, not a verb.\n\nThe French version contains a very severe bug which prevents the use of any item&mdash;since items to be used are supposed to typed, and the game recognizes neither the French nor the English spelling. As such, it is extremely difficult to become an 8-part [[Avatar]], since the player can't use the [[Silver Horn]] to get to the [[Shrine of Humility]].\n\n== Release ==\n\n''Ultima IV'' was a sensation in 1985. Because of its unique story, it sold very well and inspired many other developers.\n\nThe game was included in several compilations:\n* ''[[Ultima Trilogy IV V VI]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Ultima I-VI Series]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Ultima Collection]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Included with the game ===\n\nThe release of ''Ultima IV'' included these item with the game:\n* The book ''[[The History of Britannia]]''.\n* The book ''[[The Book of Mystic Wisdom]]''.\n* A cloth map of [[Ultima IV Map of Britannia|Britannia in ''Ultima IV'']].\n* An [[Ankh Amulet|ankh amulet]].\n\n== Upgrades ==\n\n=== Bug patches ===\nThe versions for MOS-6502-based 8-bit systems (Apple II, Commodore, Atari 8-bit) suffer from a bug where the player always gets the same message when meditating in the [[Shrine]]s, no matter how many cycles they stay. This doesn't make the game unwinnable, but removes some more or less important hints to the player. Patches exist at least for Apple and Commodore.\n\n=== Upgrade Patch ===\nThe fan-made [[Ultima IV Upgrade Patch]] for the IBM-PC version lifts the graphics to 256 color VGA, and also adds the missing music, a frame limiter, hotkeys and several other fixes and extras.\n\n===xu4===\nThere has also been an fan effort to create a platform-independent port of ''Ultima IV'' called [[xu4]]. Xu4 is a nearly complete and extremely accurate port of the original ''Ultima IV''. Advantages include greater compatibility with modern operating systems (DOS sound drivers work poorly in Windows) and an array of options to either improve the gaming experience or help retain the original feel. It is also an open source project.\n\n===Flash Version===\n[[Ultima 4: Online Flash Version]] is fan-made, and as of May 2010, it is still under development.\n\n===Remakes===\nThere are also a couple of ''Ultima IV'' remakes; the most notable ones are two mods for the game [[wikipedia:Neverwinter Nights|Neverwinter Nights]]. They are [http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&id=293#Files Avatarship - Ultima 4] and [http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&id=2693 Ultima IV Reborn].\n\n==Bugs, easter eggs and real-life references==\n* For bugs in this game, see [[Bugs#Ultima IV|Ultima IV Bugs]].\n* For easter eggs and real-life references in this game, see [[Real-Life references and Easter Eggs#Ultima IV|Ultima IV Real-life references and easter eggs]].\n* For nitpicks for this game, see [[Ultima IV Nitpicks]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n[[Image:U4 Advertisement.png|right|150px|thumb|An Ultima IV ad]]\n[[File:UltimaIV-NES advertisement.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Ultima IV (NES) Advertisement]]\n* First appearance of [[Britannia]] and [[the Eight Virtues]].\n* This is the only ''Ultima'' that is now freeware.\n* Richard Garriott himself sees it as the best part of the series, a little before ''[[Ultima VII]]''.\n* This is one of the few RPGs where there is no villain to defeat.\n* In early Apple versions, if you answered the final questions in the Abyss incorrectly even once, you are ejected back to the surface.<ref>Computer Gaming World 25 (1986): 14</ref>\n* For the first ten thousand moves, only four types of monsters spawn, for the second ten thousand only eight, and after that the game \"breaks loose.\"<ref>Computer Gaming World 26 (1986): 20</ref>\n* In the earliest Apple versions, it was impossible to finish the game without attacking a civilian if you started the game as a Ranger, because you needed to talk to the Ankh in Skara Brae and the Ranger that joins the party blocks the way.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://www.notableultima.com/collectibles/Title_U4.html The collectible Ultima-Ultima IV]\n\n* [http://www.ultimainfo.net/Codex/Ultima4.htm The Other Codex-Ultima IV]\n\n* [http://www.moongates.com/u4/upgrade/Upgrade.htm Graphics upgrade and music patch for Ultima IV]\n\n* [http://xu4.sf.net xu4 - Windows upgrade for Ultima IV]\n\n* [http://members.inode.at/357352/english/nitpicks_u4.htm Nitpicks for Ultima IV]\n\n* [http://aiera.timeimmortal.net/ultima4.php Ultima Aiera Ultima IV resources]\n\n* [http://www.mastersystem8.com/game/565/ultima_iv/ Play Ultima IV Sega Master System]\n* [http://www.paradroid.net/u4/ Ultima IV Gold], an improved Ultima IV for the C64.\n* [http://www.phipsisoftware.com/ultima4/Ultima4.html Ultima 4 Online], a Flash version of Ultima 4.\n\n* [http://imgur.com/qtZSc.png Fully Annotated Large Map of Britainnia] (SPOILER)\n\n* [[wikipedia:Ultima IV|Wikipedia's article on Ultima IV]]\n\n{{Game nav}}\n[[Category:Ultima IV| Ultima IV]]",

Even though at the time Disney deemed the film too intense for children, Burton [[Frankenweenie (feature)|remade it]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Image:Frankenweenie.jpg|left|thumb|72px|Sparky]]The story begins with a young boy named Victor Frankenstein showing a home movie that he created with his dog Sparky and several puppets and props that recreated a scene involving dinosaurs and a caveman. As the film concludes his parents and friends congratulate him and Sparky on their wonderful performances. Victor then begins to play fetch with Sparky, but accidentally sends Sparky into the middle of the road and is incidentally run over. The next day at school Victor learns about electricity and the nervous system and (after witnessing his teacher demonstrate how to make a dead frog move by introducing electricity to it's body) decides to attempt to bring Sparky back to life. He goes to the cemetery where Sparky is buried, digs him up, and creates a large contraption on his roof which vaguely resembles the one from the movie Frankenstein meant to harness the power of lightening to charge his body and bring him back to life. Victor is successful and Sparky comes back as a zombie pup with all of his body parts reattached with sloppy stitching. Victor tries desperately to hide Sparky from his neighboors, but they eventually discover what he has done and form an angry mob determined to kill Spark. Sparky is scared off by the mob and Victor follows him. Sparky leads victor to an old abandoned miniature golf course and hides inside of a small windmill. One of the men in the angry mob lights the inside of the mill with a lighter and begins to look inside to see if he can find a way to get Victor and Sparky out, but accidentally sets the mill ablaze. A plank falls out from under Victor causing him to fall and pass out from a head injury. Sparky quickly bites down on Victor's shirt and pulls him from the fire, but a burning piece of wood falls onto Sparky causing him to die. The angry mob realizes that Sparky is a true hero and not a monster. They then takes his lifeless body and attach jumper cables to him and their cars to bring him back to life.\n\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" captionalign=\"center\" captionsize=\"medium\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" columns=\"4\" widths=\"150\" bordercolor=\"green\" bordersize=\"small\" orientation=\"portrait\" >\nVictor.jpg|[[Victor Frankenstein]]\nSparky.jpg|[[Sparky]]\nSusanFrankenstein.jpg|[[Susan Frankenstein]]\nBenFrankenstein.jpg|[[Ben Frankenstein]]\nMrsCurtis.jpg|[[Mrs. Curtis]]\nRaymond.jpg|[[Raymond]]\nChambers.jpg|[[Mr. Chambers]]\nAnne.jpg|[[Anne Chambers]]\nMrWalsh.jpg|[[Mr. Walsh]]\nMikeAnderson.jpg|[[Mike Anderson]]\nFrankDale.jpg|[[Frank Dale]]\nPersephone.jpg|[[Persephone]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Tim Burton Films}}\n[[category:Short Films]]",

He confronts Ellie about the matter and she reveals that she sometimes found secret messages from their father in the classified ads in the newspaper. Coincidentally, she unintentionally gives Chuck the idea to ask his mother, who is locked in [[Castle]]. Determined to prove his mother's innocence, Chuck charms his way through an agent-infested Castle and secretly meets with her.\n\nMary tells him that Casey's findings on Project Isis were true and that she did leave the [[CIA]] during her mission to take [[Volkoff Industries]] down from the inside. Claiming she did it to protect her identity, she tells Chuck that she instead joined MI6 to complete her mission. She explains that [[Alexei Volkoff|Gregory Tuttle]], her handler at MI6, can confirm her story and tells [[Chuck]] to meet him at local bar in her place. Instead of bringing Sarah along as he did last time, Chuck brings [[Morgan Grimes]] with him to act as his back-up. While Morgan goes to restroom to fix his earpiece, Tuttle finds Chuck and they begin their meeting. However, they are both drugged and captured by Volkoff operative [[Dasha]] (Ana Gasteyer). Morgan returns from the restroom only to find Chuck's phone and earpiece left behind.\n\nMorgan tells Sarah and Casey about Chuck's rogue mission and the three of them interrogate Mary Bartowski. In exchange for visiting Ellie, Mary agrees to tell them about Chuck and Tuttle's rogue mission. Sarah takes Mary to Ellie's house where the two of them talk about old memories including the old [[1968 Ford Mustang]] that Ellie's father Stephen drove his family around in. Afterwards, Ellie searches the classifieds again and finds an ad for her father's car. She and Devon decide to go pick it up.\n\nChuck and Tuttle wake up on board a private airplane where Dasha begins to interrogate them using torture. Eventually a fight breaks out between Chuck and Volkoff's henchmen. Despite Tuttle's bumbling personality, the two are able to escape by parachuting out of the airplane. Chuck wakes up to find Tuttle has hitched them a ride back to Los Angeles in a truck loaded with sheep.\n\nThey arrive at a bank where Tuttle retrieves a package that will prove Mary Bartowski's innocence. Just as Sarah arrives with Chuck's mother, so do Dasha and Volkoff's henchmen. Confronting each other for the first time since the incident that spurred their fight, Chuck and Sarah argue while sneaking around the bank, hiding from the Volkoff henchmen. Chuck and Sarah resolve their own issues while fighting off Volkoff's men. However, Dasha fires a shot at Chuck and Tuttle jumps in the way to take the bullet. Bleeding, Tuttle gives Chuck a triangular-shaped disk that requires a specific, defunct computer to use it, one of which is in London. Fortunately, Chuck's father has the same computer in the secret basement that contains all of his research.\n\nSarah, Chuck, and Mary head to the old Bartowski home to retrieve the files off the disk. However, when Casey and Morgan arrive at the bank, they find Tuttle has disappeared leaving behind only a pool of blood. Chuck inserts the disk into his father's computer, but the disk turns out to be empty. While attempting to ask why the disk is empty, Chuck is forced by his mother to view a video on a [[portable device]] which she took from a box in the basement, and it causes him to lose the ability to flash. Tuttle walks into the basement and reveals to Chuck and Sarah that he is really Alexei Volkoff, the mastermind behind Volkoff Industries. Mary ties Chuck and Sarah up and Volkoff lays bombs around the basement while explaining to Chuck that his father wasted his life and research on a woman who truly was a rogue agent.\n\nAs Volkoff and Mary leave the basement, Mary slips Sarah a razor and whispers to her to keep Chuck safe. After Volkoff and Mary leave, Sarah cuts herself and Chuck loose and they rush out of the old Bartowski home before the bomb detonates. Chuck watches in disappointment as he cannot use the Intersect and all of his father's research has been destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ellie and Devon pick up Stephen Bartowski's old Mustang. They read a letter from Stephen (Scott Bakula in an uncredited voice cameo) where he says he trusts Ellie will know what to do. As they drive away, the Mustang is revealed to have one of Stephen's laptops in it.\n\n=== Chuck & Sarah ===\nFeeling betrayed by Sarah for capturing his mother, Chuck tells Morgan that he is in his first real fight with Sarah. Despite being in his first fight with his girlfriend, Chuck turn his attention to searching for clues from his father about his mother's true identity.\n\nLater, Chuck vents to Tuttle on the 123-mile drive to Los Angeles about his first fight with his girlfriend. At a bank in Los Angeles, Sarah and Chuck confront each other for the first time since the incident that spurred their fight, and they argue while sneaking around the bank, staying away from the Volkoff henchmen. Chuck and Sarah resolve their conflict while fighting off Volkoff's men.\n\n===Morgan and Casey===\n\nWhen Chuck vents to Morgan about his and Sarah's fight, Morgan admits that he is experiencing the same thing with Casey. Morgan confronts Casey about lying to him about Project Isis. Later, their fight is apparently resolved when Casey allows Morgan to participate in the bank mission rather than making him wait in the van.\n\n== Guest Stars ==\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as [[Alexei Volkoff|Gregory Tuttle]]\n* [[Linda Hamilton]] as [[Mary Bartowski]]\n* [[wikipedia:Ana Gasteyer|Ana Gasteyer]] as [[Dasha]]\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as the voice of [[Stephen Bartowski]] (uncredited)\n\n==Quotes==\n'''Morgan''': You know, contrary to popular belief, we think that there is a heart of gold \n[''Morgan touches Sarah's chest''] \n\n'''Morgan''': underneath this cold exterior. \n\n'''Sarah''': Morgan, please don't touch my chest. \n\n'''Morgan''': Oh, gosh, yeah.

Brought up alongside [[Sparx (The Legend of Spyro)|Sparx]], [[Spyro (The Legend of Spyro)|Spyro]] is led to believe that he himself is a dragonfly who just happens to be slightly bigger and purpler than the other dragonflies.\n\nUntil one day when the village is attacked and Spyro is found. Instinctively using his unknown powers, Spyro realizes just how different he is. Confused and upset, he learns that he is not in fact a dragonfly, but [[Purple Dragon|a dragon who carries the role of being part of a great prophecy that will bring peace to all the land]].\n\nSpyro, along with his trusty sidekick Sparx, pursue this epic adventure and attempt the impossible; the demise of the deadly [[Malefor (The Legend of Spyro)|Dark Master]]. However, between them stands [[Cynder (The Legend of Spyro)|Cynder]], a very powerful black dragon powered by the red crystal around her neck, which enslaves her to the Dark Master.\n\n==Production==\n===Music===\nThere was a possible leak of '''The Legend of Spyro 3D''' soundtrack on YouTube. The song shows a combination of the New age tone from the latest games releases and Electronica music. Due to the movie being canceled, it's still unknown if it was going to be used for the film's credits. It may have probably been fake, due to the film being canceled, or was possibly made by a user, who thought of making the soundtrack sound official would make Spyro fans believe it's real, as part of a cruel misleading. As well as this, the leaker remained anonymous, hinting the video was to annoy fans, and some users have pointed out they have heard the music before, possibly making this a rare or unused soundtrack.\n\nOn the '''8/5/2010''', the same user posted a comment announcing that he had a demo CD of the soundtrack containing '''5''' unreleased songs composed for ''''The Legend Of Spyro 3D'''' movie, and as such uploaded another track called \"Prelude To a Dream\". In the video description he said that he would upload a picture of the Demo CD later that day, as well as tracklisting for the Demo CD. He also acknowledged that the song previously leaked was part of a larger song titled''' 'Out Of This World'. '''The leaker also updated and posted the song 'Cynder's Theme' on 8/15/2010.\n\n'''1. Out Of This World (Credits theme)<br />2. Prelude To a Dream<br />3. Cynder's Theme<br />4. Heaven's Tide<br />5. Sunny Shores'''\n\nAs of May 2011, people have saved the songs using programs like [http://www.downloadhelper.net DownloadHelper] and uploaded them on YouTube, and people are now free to listen to them. It is unknown if they will be removed. If the videos of these songs get removed, it will make it more rare and difficult for users to search and find.\n\nIn April 2012, GoldfishFilms, the original leaker of the tracks, confirmed that 'Cynder's Theme' was created by Two Steps From Hell, a group famous for their 'trailer music.' However other tracks including 'Out Of This World', 'Sunny Shores', 'Prelude To a Dream' and 'Heaven's Tide' were all created as demos and were simply for animators to work with when developing certain scenes and locations, as well as when designing characters.\n\n'Out Of This World's' full runtime is somewhere between 5-6 minutes. This extra footage is reminiscent of electronica heard in previous Spyro games developed by Insomniac. This would have definitely been used for the credits due to it not fitting in with other leaked demos or footage and pictures released of the abandoned film.\n\nThe Demo CD case clearly marked that it was for 'production purposes only' and should never have been shown to the public, possibly because the songs were unfinished.\n\nThe original CD MD5 information comments are extensive, and will be released shortly.\n\n==Cancellation==\nThe movie was originally supposed to be released in the United States and Canada on Christmas 2009, but it got delayed and pushed back to the date of April 10, 2010. However, over the weekend of April 10-11, the movie did not come out and that was proven to be false. It had been confirmed by one of the movie writers, Daniel Altiere himself, that the movie had been officially cancelled due to decisions made by Activision to go in a different direction.<ref>[http://darkspyro.net/news/28705/ Spyro Movie No More]</ref> That direction in which Activision decided to take was later on revealed on February 2011, to be in the form of ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', which is the second reboot of the ''Spyro'' series. It is still unknown if there will ever be a new distributor or a new director to get the rights to circle and re-work the project for the film.\n\nNo official trailers or updated information on the movie were ever revealed, and the only merchandise was a fake poster available from online stores such as eBay. As well as this, no stands or posters were displayed in theaters, and commercials never aired.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The ''finalized'' voice actors for [[Sparx (The Legend of Spyro)|Sparx]] and [[Cynder (The Legend of Spyro)|Cynder]] were never confirmed during the film's production.\n*The IMDB Website had a release date for a Turkish dubbed version to be premiered in Turkey which was supposed to be released on February 18, 2010. Since that never came through, that was definitely also proven to be false.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{LegendGames}}\n{{Games}}\n[[Category:Articles in need of proper categorization]]\n[[Category:Media]]\n[[Category:The Legend of Spyro]]",

    "title": "Star Trek: The Final Frontier",
    "wikiText": "{{realworld}}\n'''''Star Trek: The Final Frontier''''' is a board [[games|game]] produced for the UK market by BMI, a subsidiary of [[Toys & Games Limited]] in {{y|1992}}. The game is for two to six players, and was produced in two versions. It is presumed that Version 1 (pictured in images 1 & 3 below, with the cruder graphics) was produced BEFORE Version 2 (as pictured in images 2 & 4 below), which is difficult to verify without owning both versions of the game, as they both have a 1992 copyright on them. However, upon closer examination, the main differences seem to be mainly cosmetic, focusing mainly on graphic changes to the various game components and fixing of spelling and reference errors. For example, references on game cards to \"Romulons\", \"Ohora\" and \"Scottie\" in V1 are corrected to \"[[Romulan]]s\", \"[[Nyota Uhura|Uhura]]\", and \"[[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]]\" in V2. None of these changes alter gameplay in any notable way, so both editions of the game are functionally identical.\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:STFinalFrontierGameBox1.jpg|1. Version 1<br />Game box\nFile:STFinalFrontierGameBox2.jpg|2. Version 2<br />Game box\nFile:STFFV1Components.jpg|3. Version 1<br />Game components\nFile:STFFV2Components.jpg|4. Version 2<br />Game components\n</gallery>\n\n==Game components==\nThe V1 parts list is as follows:\n* 1 4-piece game board\n* 6 \"Star Ship ''Enterprise'' Characters\"<sup>'''1'''</sup>\n* 6 \"Playing Stands\"<sup>'''1'''</sup>\n* 24 \"''Star Trek'' Cards\"\n* 24 \"Destination Cards\"\n* 1 6-sided die\n* 1 rule sheet\n\n<sup>'''1'''</sup>In V2, these pieces are replaced by \"6 Playing Pieces\".\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe object of the game is to reach four assigned destination [[planet]]s and return to [[Earth]] before your opponents. \n\nThe game board (which is a four-piece board put together jigsaw puzzle style) depicts a \"Solar Chart\" with eleven planets (including Earth), ten of which are destinations the players must reach. Some of the planets are incorrectly named, such as \"Klingon\" instead of [[Qo'noS]] and \"Ferengal\" instead of [[Ferenginar]]. In addition, some of the planets and graphics featured in the game are from the [[TNG]] era, even though the game itself is supposed to be [[TOS]]-based. (Indeed, gameplay is very similar to the original [[Ideal]] [[Star Trek Game (1967)|''Star Trek'' Game]] and the later [[Milton Bradley]] {{film|1}}-based [[Star Trek Game (1979)|''Star Trek'' Game]].)\n\nPlayers choose a \"ship\" (in V1, a marker in one of six colors with the TNG [[combadge]] graphic and the legend \"[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''ENTERPRISE'']]\"; in V2 a standard plastic pawn) and place it on Earth on the game board. The \"Mission Pack\" Deck (aka the Destination Deck, with pictures of [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]] and [[Spock]] on the backs in both versions) is shuffled and four cards are dealt to each player (any duplicate cards are returned to the deck and re-drawn until each of the four cards have a different destination). Players then roll the six-sided die to determine play order and to move around the board. \n\nLanding on a planet (not necessarily by exact count) that is on one of the player's destinations allows that player to discard the Mission Pack card with that planet's name. The player then needs to roll an odd number (1, 3 or 5) to \"re-launch\" their \"ship\" into the \"spacelanes\".\n\nLanding on special spaces (those with a TNG combadge graphic in V1 or a five-pointed star in V2) requires the player to draw a card from the ''Star Trek'' Deck (In V1, cards having the TNG combadge graphic and the legend \"USS ''ENTERPRISE''\" on the back; in V2, cards having a white five-pointed star and the legend \"''STAR TREK'' CARDS\" on a blue background on the back) which may help or hinder their progress.\n\nLanding on a black space (a \"[[Black hole|Black Hole]]\") lets the player's left-hand opponent move you to any other \"Black Hole\" space on the board (thus acting more like [[wormhole]]s than Black Holes), which again may help or hinder the player in their game play.\n\nOnce a player has reached their fourth destination, they must return to Earth (this time by EXACT COUNT) to win the game.\n[[Category:Games]]",
